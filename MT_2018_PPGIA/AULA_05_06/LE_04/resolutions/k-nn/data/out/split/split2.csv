i dont expect much from eddie murphy these days for the past four years the gods of cinema or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates have allowed him to make one bad movie after another such films as metro doctor dolittle holy man life and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed up hack performing as a studio puppet for th century fox and universal pictures the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film nutty professor ii the klumps the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places sherman has just invented a new youth drink that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor and for the most ridiculous reasons with love on his mind sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego buddy love from the first professor who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers with some convoluted mumbo jumbo about dna extraction sherman extracts the buddy love link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy dandy lab beaker but one night the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy then the klump family all played by eddie murphy step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex flabby breasts a slew of fart and dick jokes and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene pure and simple the klumps is a failure its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process its more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade american pie have their names stamped to this trash hey guys quick note keep this movie off of your resumes the characterization of shermans family the klumps is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts the father is gruff is fired from a blue collar job is sexually inadequate and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct and you got the feeling that these crass people couldnt act like this all the time the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last or so unbearable and pathetic after a while their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line even the best effects cant seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days now that i think about it the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make people will be lined up around the block for it the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles but hell play every character in the movie i just cant wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself, 0
numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi suspense thrillers soldier is a multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground besides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography russell who is usually a good actor in b grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like a sergeant toad besides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombie like which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still a long way from anything considered desirable, 0
love to kill starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes at the outset the movie appears to be about tony danza whos an illegal distributor of guns trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman danza sets up a double date with her her sister and a collegue of his everything seems to be going well until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs much confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up and other associates of danzas begin to emerge all after one thing or another sound confusing it is i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity in some respects it works but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess characters keep popping up with no explanation demanding money for deals that occur off screen the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister but so little time is devoted to this part of the story we never really become too familiar with these characters and because of this we dont really care what happens to them well i didnt at least one thing i will give the movie is that its a complete departure for tony danza heres a guy because of his many sitcom roles whos ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing here he plays a man whos just looking out for himself and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin so be it i was very impressed by his performance and within minutes of the start of the film i had forgotten all about his good guy persona michael madsen is also good as an associate of danzas who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him like i said its not exactly a linear storyline love to kill should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre but its just too bad that the story doesnt really add up to much the stars deserved better and so did the audience, 0
the first film produced by adam sandlers happy madison production company clever title eh is essentially a one joke movie much like the movies sandler stars in himself however the difference here is that this one joke just isnt very funny rob schneider stars as the title character a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a man whore to raise enough money to replace a wealthy clients custom made fish tank which deuce destroyed while staying in his home deuce goes on numerous dates and each woman he goes out with has a humorous quirk about herself one has narcolepsy one has tourettes syndrome one is a man etc etc my problem is that we see all of these women in the films trailer so why do i need to watch the movie seen the trailer seen the film only a quick cameo from norm macdonald and a follow up joke during the closing credits generates any chuckles deuce bigalow male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video a division of diney the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of and features the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for mystery alaska happy texas and outside providence an extremely brief production featurette which contains footage not used in the film and storyboard to scene comparisons yep you read that right there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd two scenes are storyboarded neither of which are particularly exciting there are fight scenes in this movie so why arent we seeing storyboards of those segments especially the parody moments from the matrix i wonder whats funnier the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that diney thought fans of this film would want to see them deleted scenes sure audio commentary you betcha but storyboards come on r, 0
the classic story the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the h g wells classic new line cinema armed with a stellar cast and expert make up effects man stan winston alien predator terminator etc churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel of course the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier movies one of which was made back in the and the other in the under the title the island of lost souls sounds like a much better title the story begins with edward douglas thewlis a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery kilmer after his plane crashes into the sea douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr moreau who incidently owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize his hosts reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreaus lab when a monstrous birth was in progress even worse the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal people douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast people community which considers dr moreau their maker using shock therapy and the law dr moreau has long been able to keep his beast people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal men who are just too savage to be controlled the island of dr moreau questions the ability of men playing god dr moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp even so the production has failed to make the most out of it there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is the characters are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather ungloriously at times too perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreaus creations the two very important characters montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development i really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreaus obsession montgomerys purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast people had to rebel maybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently does not incorporate much action sequences in the film forced the filmmakers to cut a long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else its still summer and movies have to be marketable the special effects too are really nothing for anyone to shout about at most i would say the beast men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes this h g wells classic really has potential to be a good film unfortunately after adaptations they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story as a third outing the island of dr moreau accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of the planet of the apes the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv broadcast a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice, 0
edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is a working class relationship picture however unlike his previous work the film dwells on a more personal story and with a female protagonist and in no looking back he stumbles making a slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work claudia lauren holly is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life shes at a turning point in her life and feels as if shes going nowhere her boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in a dead end job if she were to marry him shed never get a chance to escape this town enter charlie edward burns claudias old flame he skipped town several years before without any explanations even for claudia he has come back to town to see her and suddenly she is torn should she stay with stable michael and never escape her hometown or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again part of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudias father to return now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes at only a little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre unfortunately it seems much much longer the storyline is simple and uninspired and theres a lack of energy to the whole proceedings which makes the entire drama rather tedious edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame theres no one to restrain his ego which reigns unchecked he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah right lauren holly does what she can with her central character but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and we never really care bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie his acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with theres not much to recommend in no looking back its not that the film is bad its simply boring theres no zest in any aspect of the film and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it, 0
one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish and one of his best was his last film lone star after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us mexico border expectation ran high for his next film unfortunately his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do then the film does exactly what it promised a painful as that is the plot of men with guns can be summarized in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas dr fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went and he found out again and again and again of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians but the film talks down to the viewer dr fuentes played by federico luppi teaches medicine in the capital city of his country he has as a great humanitarian gesture trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others the student tells him the others are still in the mountains but suggests that it may not be a good place to be fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general the results are little different than one would expect dr fuentes starts out incredibly naive even some american tourists present in the film mostly for comic relief seem to know better than dr fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was sayles certainly could have used minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer, 0
it rocks actually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they land once in a while when we need a break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon a steroid users answer to deep impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper a famed oil driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect a deep core driller they built based on his blueprints it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa to build space shuttles harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including a blond guy a fat guy a black guy a wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day i will not reveal nor will you care i will say this you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely a chance to come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in a last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material steve buscemis character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic rockhound as hes called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to a chair where he spends most of the film so why did they bring him up there to begin with rather why write him into the film give his almost witty one liners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her fathers bands aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie on screen the middle hour is a non sensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain whenever someone dies in this movie a crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead persons last name here i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil guy cum astronaut from a live one and close ups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework it has a vivid soundmix but at almost two and a half hours i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever bollocks the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon crawler remember a little film called jaws in this film three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark they didnt much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances id be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest beating bravery to this i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldnt build a birdhouse and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer a trailer for a movie written by a team of body builders and greeting card authors ive never been a prouder wimp my whole life, 0
traffic violation dr daniels review of u turn dr ds rating critical condition okay heres the deal ill be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then ill even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well i mean hey ive been known to stretch a weekend into a three day outing if friday looks to be a slow day and if monday aint looking like a pick me up well ive been known to give martha nell a call and say do me a favor sweetheart bump old man fergusons boil lancing to tuesday morning and tell miss audrey that ill swing by her house monday evening and see if we cant get her trick knee back in line a simple sentence like that and ive got a nice four day fishing trip with the boys or more often than not a trip up to cherokee n c for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery but the point is if you take a day off do something different if youve worked yourself silly for months relax a bit sleep in eat pancakes at noon microwave an egg in its shell watch pro wrestling with the sound off listen to some barry white records at high speed whatever but do not under any circumstances spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living and if you do dont make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time because i do not want to hear your sob stories oliver stone you apparently thought you needed a break from making important films cool so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie thats cool too but ollie old sage do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade im just eager to meet you one day so i can buy you a stoli look you in the eye and say what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u turn and ill stand there staring til i get a straight answer sean penn stars u turn as bobby a drifter whos had some troubles a while back hes heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose stranding him in superior arizona held there by an ignorant inbred turtleneck hick of a mechanic named darrell while darrell puts a new hose on the ride bobby walks into town to see whats cooking is it needless of me to say that superior arizona is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely probably not bobby meets up with grace jennifer lopez who invites him back to her place for drape hanging and other domestic issues just as those issues are starting up graces husband jake storms in looking like check out day of the elks lodge convention just beats bobby silly bobby takes to the road only to meet up with jake again and jake asks bobby to kill grace a little while later grace asks bobby to kill jake them murderous arizonians gotta love em if any of this sounds familiar congratulations you win a kewpie doll the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl maker of the phenomenal the last seduction but the contest doesnt end there guys and gals we get steals from russ meyer movies where everybody in town is horny and sweaty we get the town from bad day at black rock minus the train plus busty women who can speak look at any schwarzenegger film and youll see our hero bobby as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times gets bit by a tarantula gets shot at and ends up with vultures circling overhead all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick bobby as terminator stretch it a bit and we have a five finger discount from doc hollywood where the whole story occurs because of car trouble forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic okay hes working from a book so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative i just wish he hadnt brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe stub sean penn gives a great performance and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be playing over the top caricatures of stereotype characters the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety blank is going on too bad its not fun to watch when its happening to us while we sit through this mess of a film u turn is not a bad film if youre a fan of technique its the oliver stone youve always known robert richardson is his usual cinematographer and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick great camera angles shifting viewpoints wicked colors nice looking pictures but pictures of what i think id rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt o whirl point of this loser film plot twists are one thing repetition is almost unforgivable and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ive seen in the past five years oliver i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at youve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie and films like platoon jfk wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on your scripts are certainly respectable your budgets are up there on the screen and your actors dont dog it and i know that maybe with u turn you were just kicking back just having fun thats fine but dont do that with a movie with the potential of this one do some police academy sequel imagine that do a big comedy like a remake of its a mad mad mad mad world but do not drop a limp u turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as an oliver stone movie and not question why it stinks like week old snook theres a right way to have fun and a wrong way to have fun this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail, 0
a follow up to disneys live action dalmatians thats better more entertaining than the first just as unlikely with dalmatians the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely not the merrier s dalmatians certainly wasnt the greatest movie going experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous larger than life performance in addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen and closes facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the year old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers but thats only half the problem with kevin limas laborious film what makes dalmatians such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor here almost single handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks hes a dog voiced by eric idle its rabid plotlessness cruella goes after puppies again winds up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic heroes of the piece a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander than bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo gruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans cant even aspire to that the dogs upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even closes split ends are more animated bad acting however seems to be a requirement for this sequel since g rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niros in men of honor jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieus over the top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail frances most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself and in dalmatians the producers milk that realization for all its worth le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as poopies par example and ad nauseum the finesses of the script attributed to four screenwriters no less and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben that done its back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown the dogs are pretty cute try making a puppy look otherwise but thats pretty much all they are theres always the feeling that theres a trainer off in the wings coaxing the dogs to open doors or pick up their food bowls in unison or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder savvy holiday goers should skip dalmatians and pop the original animated classic into their vcrs instead its one dalmatian less but more satisfying, 0
when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy i expect negative reviews from critics left and right predictable unoriginal and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to yous and the drive me crazys released by the dozens these last couple of years what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while im sitting in the theater am i enjoying myself is this a comfortable break from my week of finals this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i wont remember next week so last week i opened up the new york times and no surprise boys and girls got a negative review daily news negative reelviews negative epinions com negative this was nothing new american pie final destination road trip didnt get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures same goes for shes all that a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded since boys and girls reunites shes all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr i predicted d j vu al over again but still curious i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it the reactions were far from positive i had made up my mind ill catch it on video or cable in a couple of years but soon after following a series of unexpected events we couldnt get into shaft because it is rated r i found myself watching boys and girls whoops boys and girls is about a nerdy smart boy named ryan prinze jr and a popular flirt girl named jennifer claire forlani briefly meeting as pre teens and now attending the same college the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends but in the movies a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other with advice from their roommates amanda detmer jason biggs ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found i could hardly sit through the minute running time for several reasons the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to it is almost offensive an example of an insightful conversation youre dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb no followed by a mandy moore esque tune background well its not as bad as wing commander i guess the supporting cast is also painfully useless detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring pointless subplots and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex prinze jrs ryan dominates the screen while forlanis jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character teenager or not youll hate this movie i guarantee it maybe i should rent shes all that again is it really as good as i think it is, 0
party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ive seen in awhile a late rip off of the meatballs series the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk thats really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wise cracking jerry andrew ross has the hots for a cute blonde kerry brennan and there is a big contest in the climax how fun since party camp has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative its not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick at least then it wouldnt have been such a chore to sit through never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat the comedy was easy to spot but it wasnt the least bit funny it was groan inducing constantly throghout i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything so what saves party camp from the dreaded zero star rating well thats simple jewel shepard as a flighty bimbo was admittedly fun to watch although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid low budget teen comedy, 0
it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers james horner what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of what drags braveheart down is its screenplay it abounds with high production values john tolls award winning cinematography which also graced edward zwicks legends of the fall a gorgeous score by horner and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names but this does not save a misguided script the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero but the viewers only response to his heroism is intellectual william wallace producer director mel gibson is fighting for freedom and against tyranny so we have to root for him but wallaces actions paint a different story he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king wallace speaks of freedom but his acts point toward vengeance after kicking the english out of scotland he decides to invade england this is evident of a spartacus complex and this example applies both historically and cinematically the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities the film spartacus like braveheart has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film horners score tries to make emotional connection but the performances and the script do not help gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him this drags down any emotional connection to the films plot and turns three hours into a total waste of time, 0
one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean luc godard film after all he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave he is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing however his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels and reconciliation these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples young adult and elderly it is edgars bruno putzulu self appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup to define a central idea its only when things are over that they make sense whether this project will end up a play film or opera remains undecided the thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes the next scene no more engaging than the last only once does any character utter something worthwhile but by the time it happens youre so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it but dont fret it will surface again you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film as some fellow critics did and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile but you hold hope for some time the background music keeps you in a state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversations its only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope and with speeches like i am thinking of something but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else how can you expect to hold anyones interest to godards credit he certainly knows how to frame a scene the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him and if this film had anything poignant to say you would have which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities the environments be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complements them unfortunately godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words the second half is composed of nauseating hyper color that often blurs the image you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies steven spielberg is picked on in particular while ill grant that this does happen and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage its still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood it just goes to show an intelligent person isnt necessarily an admirable storyteller the days of breathless are no more, 0
spawn features good guys bad guys lots of fighting bloody violence a leather clad machine gun chick gooey self healing bullet holes scatological humor and a man eating monster it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of and year old boys it appears to have been made by them in a classic example of telling and not showing spawn opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness forces of light and how men are the ones who create evil on earth so much for a message the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons michael jai white a government assassinoperative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn martin sheen who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant simmons goes to hell and back after making a deal with satan himself if he agrees to command the devils army to overtake the world hell be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda underused theresa randle and little girl cyan sydni beaudoin of course seeing as how five years has passed wanda has fallen for and married simmons partner d b sweeney his uh shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown john leguizamo a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satans clown manipulates simmons now in superhuman spawn form into a stand off with wynn wynn who thinks he is in league with the double dealing clown recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart when it stops beating major cities around the world will detonate causing the leak of a disease that makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash phew got all that it would be easy to dismiss spawn as just another one of those heavy on fx short on substance action pics but it doesnt even work on that level the computer generated sequences are often and plenty and the problem is that they look too computer generated the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic with the movies healthy budget youd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks other elements of the movie are so so spawns enormous red flowing cape is a wonderful sight but its too obvious when hes being played by a costumed actor or an image in movies like contact the special effects serve the story in spawn they are the story and spawn himself isnt even an interesting character the films reliance on razzle dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for but both simmons and his funky alter ego are completely underdeveloped what we need is a batman a luke skywalker even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn poor leguizamo he starred in februarys the pest a movie that i still think is the years worst so far although this one does give it a run for its money as clown he overacts to the extreme never missing an opportunity for a poor taste punchline leguizamo farts green mist munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini skirt and performs a cheerleader routine all before turning into a giant grey demon the guy was brilliant in to wong foo thanks for everything julie newmar what is he doing wasting his talent in this and the pest im one of the few people that liked batman robin this summers other big budget comic book film yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison i can only hope people will change their minds and think of batman as the superior adaptation theres a compelling story somewhere in spawn including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african american superhero ever but its just not found anywhere near here as it is spawn is just awful it stinks worse than a dead trout, 0

five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there is this starting to sound familiar by mistake the girls accidentlly open the box big surprise huh and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one betcha didnt see that one coming hard to die i found out while watching the film is a sequel to sorority house massacre nightie nightmare r a m r two of the actresses from sorority house massacre are in this film robyn harris and melissa moore but they play different characters here orville ketchum is also back as get ready for this orville ketchum yes the same character from number two yes he is also built like a tank in this film too im telling you a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldnt harm him at all the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act well they seemed to have lost that ability thankfully for my sanity i also saw the film warlock which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out analyzed and discarded before it happens there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot while we are on the subject of the story the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the managers office im sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary ridiculous and hurts the story more if that is still possible the script for this film is completely pathetic the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along here is an example of the wonderful dialog the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a really big gun the line is my dad used to be a marine i bet i can work it this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy now we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan has been presented one comment from an actress is not a lot of strategy involved but i like it im afraid folks that this is about as good as they get now lets talk about the great special effects for this film this obviously wasnt a big concern of the film makers the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewers intelligence a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the th movie are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get the continuity department was obviously asleep along with the viewers when watching this film in one shot actress has cloths on camera angle changes actress seems to have lost clothing very impressive trick the one half plus that this film has going for it is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny and so the viewer can get some enjoyment from the film however this doesnt make it worth the rental fee of over a penny in the acting department the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least oh well win some lose some, 0
synopsis a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boys mother a fledgling restauranteur unsuccessfully attempting to gain the womans favor he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way comments stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned psychos getting their revenge type movies which are a stable category in the s film industry both theatrical and direct to video their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that theyre typically inexpensive to produce no special effects no big name stars and serve as vehicles to flash nudity allowing them to frequent late night cable television stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect the psycho never actually has an affair on the contrary hes rejected rather quickly the psycho typically is an ex lover ex wife or ex husband other than that stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable stalked does not provide much suspense though that is what it sets out to do interspersed throughout the opening credits for instance a serious sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk its implicitly implied that all stalkers are men while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen after these credits a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears the narrator states that this is the story of daryl gleason and tells the audience that he is the stalker of course really this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels if the movie was meant to be about daryl then it should have been called stalker not stalked okay so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts no guesswork required stalked proceeds then as it begins obvious obvious obvious the opening sequence contrived quite a bit brings daryl and brooke the victim together daryl obsesses over brooke follows her around and tries to woo her ultimately rejected by her his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate these plans include the all time psycho in love cliche the murdered pet for some reason this genres films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked stalked is no exception its a cat this time found in the shower events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked where only one survives guess who it invariably always is and youll guess the conclusion to this turkey stalkeds cast is uniformly adequate not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either jay underwood as the stalker turns toward melodrama a bit too much he overdoes it in other words but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands maryam dabo about the only actor close to being a star here she played the bond chick in the living daylights is equally adequate as the stalked of the title even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong independent business owner brooke dabo needs to be ditzy however for the plot to proceed toward the end for example brooke has her suspicions about daryl to ensure he wont use it as another excuse to see her brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers of course not she tries the door opens it and wanders around the house when daryl returns he enters the house of course so our heroine is in danger somehow even though her car is parked at the front of the house right by the front door daryl is oblivious to her presence inside the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audiences suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either characters intelligence stalked receives two stars because even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring it is not so bad that it cannot be watched rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are if youre in the mood for a good suspense film though stake out something else, 0
lake placid marks yet another entry in the series of predator pics that were a screen staple in the late s post jaws and were revived recently by the godawful anaconda placid claims to be a horrorcomedy its directed by the same guy who did house but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of anaconda paleontologist kelly scott bridget fonda is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile which shouldnt even be in this hemisphere kelly goes croc hunting with game warden jack wells bill pullman and sheriff hank keough brendan gleeson theyre joined by an unwelcome guest hector cyr oliver platt a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them along the way the merry band meets mrs delores bickerman betty white a weird old lady who lives out on the lake you know what to expect from this movie lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator croc cam swimming toward someones dangling legs while jaws like music plays one character hector whos obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest another character who insists that the predator cant possibly exist unlike its slippery cousin anaconda lake placid wants to present its formulaic plot tongue in cheek which is self defeating the result is neither scary nor funny its just tedious while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume including two installments of friday the th and halloween h screenwriter david kelley best known as the creator of tv series like ally mcbeal and chicago hope doesnt seem to have the stomach for a chomp em up flick the body count is surprisingly low and doesnt include any of the major characters and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it lake placid manages to have it both ways ill let you discover how for yourself the croc itself is mostly computer generated of course like the snake in anaconda the thirty foot monster crocodile doesnt seem real it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural lake placid also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine there is a lot of semi mystical mumbo jumbo about how we really dont know much about crocodiles they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers a movie like this doesnt have to offer much of an explanation radioactive mutant creature from outer space but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto pilot most of the time theyre probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers platt and white on the other hand seem to be giving their best efforts and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script, 0

she was the femme in la femme nikita he was the baldwin in backdraft sliver and fair game with cindy crawford together anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make shattered image the biggest piece of hooey since the stallonestone thriller the specialist the film poses the question what if the life youre living now is really a dream and your dreams reality its either about a woman whos haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that shes a hired assassin or its about a hired assassin whos haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that shes honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica it doesnt much matter and believe me by the time shattered image runs its painful and pedestrian course you wont care these two lives with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig black emotionless eyes and black leather clothing in the seattle based assassin scenes and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is its now twice as boring as it might have been its not that complicated plots cant be entertaining of course it helps if you have interesting characters crisp dialogue and a modicum of style shattered image isnt complex its just stupid and boring parillaud and baldwin who arent exactly shakespearean material to begin with are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines lines like you dont beg you insist i like that in a woman thats parillauds character talking to her cat and youre not the reason i couldnt care less about you huh and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film if you give me a couple of minutes you know ill charm the pants off you i dont have that kind of time talking of pants parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say point of no return we have come to expect this from billy baldwin but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first but theres nothing to learn karen is as interesting as a cereal box a someones out to get me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone the stranger who sends her flowers maybe even her husband himself is her would be killer siouxsie is the chromium cool tough as nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the films meaningless stock title baldwin seems more interested in parillauds nest egg so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot than he does in her each time graham greene shows up he gets killed barbet schroeder reversal of fortune co produced and should be ashamed of himself every now and again its fun to watch a really bad movie and every now and again as shattered image makes agonizingly clear it isnt, 0
the happy bastards quick movie review damn that y k bug its got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother william this time in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on little do they know the power within going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there virus still feels very empty like a movie going for all flash and no substance we dont know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere we dont know the origin of what took over the ship just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir and of course we dont know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout here its just hey lets chase these people around with some robots the acting is below average even from the likes of curtis youre more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h sutherland is wasted and baldwin well hes acting like a baldwin of course the real star here are stan winstons robot design some schnazzy cgi and the occasional good gore shot like picking into someones brain so if robots and body parts really turn you on heres your movie otherwise its pretty much a sunken ship of a movie, 0
instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as powerful or touching i have a name for it myself gross this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully the bully looks at the rebel threateningly about to hurt him and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me arent present day moviegoers beyond being inspired by something like that this is one example there are actually some more in instinct alone of filmmakers insulting the audiences intelligence instincts plot is brimming with potential world renowned anthropologist ethan powell anthony hopkins disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport the authorities stick him in a prisons psychotics ward assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright or so we are told young psychiatrist theo caulder cuba gooding jr caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career of course and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison and then theres the inevitable heartless meanie character in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulders mentor he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell lets get one thing straight dr theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen on screen or off any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way not good old theo no he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says we need to talk about this right now this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instincts already dubious credibility unfortunately its also the least of its problems director jon turteltaub who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that contrary to what this movies promotion would have you believe it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs its not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus excuse the graphic depiction it aims to inspire rather than to touch hearts as yoda would say inspire it does not it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter the very experienced gerald di pego has to resort to literally telling the audience a movies story indeed somewhere in the beginning of instinct one of the characters actually reads aloud the films plot to another character this like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review is a horrid insult to our intelligence i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors and he chews the scenery in this movie brilliant as ever oscar winner cuba gooding jr on the other hand is dreadful his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling i love animals and instincts prominent save the gorillaslive in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with however this movies execution is completely unacceptable tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick eugene novikov, 0
of course i knew this going in why is it that whenever a tv star makes a movie its always a romantic comedy and then they say on entertainment tonight or something that they were attracted to the characters they were really original original let me give you a run through of picture perfect character a kate jennifer aniston from tvs friends a smart beautiful professional woman wants two things she cant have a new job title and the love of her co worker kevin bacon her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls what does she do she invents a fiance then when everyone wants to meet him she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner and pick a fight with her at the end thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor defenceless female he of course goes along with it gee i wonder if they get together in the end ive seen more original stuff on the wb and better stuff too picture perfect also makes the mistake of being wayyyyy too long at minutes and expecting us to like anistons character who comes off as a cold spoiled bitch, 0
it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch based on the late s television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover however things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion of course the ads make it seem like so much more quick cuts cool music claire danes nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like sounds like a cool movie does it not after the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production complete with nice hair and costumes but that simply isnt enough the film is best described as a cross between an hour long cop show and a music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half and with it comes every single clich it doesnt really matter that the film is based on a television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything weve already seen the characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored which really transfers onto the audience the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching unfortunately even hes not enough to save this convoluted mess as all the characters dont do much apart from occupying screen time with the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset despite an american r rating which the content does not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset information on the characters is literally spoon fed to the audience would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable the way the film progresses you likely wont even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because youll know they arent basing the show on a s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one thats missing a finger or two the number of times that i checked my watch six is a clear indication that this film is not one of them it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teen flicks that weve been seeing as of late avoid this film at all costs, 0
one of the responses those that enjoy detroit rock city probably kiss fans mostly might have upon first glance at the rating ive given the film might be something like oh that caseys gone and become a jaded critic on us just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n roll movie like this im wondering the same thing i feel like i should have had a grand time with detroit rock city its the sort of movie i wish i couldve had a lot of fun with but i didnt i just didnt surely this film isnt trying to win any major awards so should i have expected an oscar caliber film no but i expected something a funny joke a clever prank a plot development anything the movie never delivers youve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing detroit rock city is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the films existence and its not a very satisfying realization the film is about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit michigan thats it there is no big plot description in this review because the movie has very little plot the characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington they have a garage band theyre pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock n roll so i guess that means we root for them they have tickets they lose them they get more tickets they lose those too they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets most of which backfire theres not much more to it frankly it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity oh and jam real name jeremiah has a really really annoying ultra religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency she doesnt want them to see kiss if you hadnt figured that out already its really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this weve got plenty of kiss along with some acdc ramones and thin lizzy then again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big acdc fan that i am but is probably one of the worst movies of all time detroit rock city doesnt quite reach that level of ineptitude but it gets dangerously close in fact the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind basically the soundtrack has earned the film a full half star which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose half hearted cover of acdcs highway to hell sounds like something my neighbors cat coughed up its also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste because it s evident that theyre all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie edward furlong has done far better work than this and so has natasha lyonne and so has lin shaye but hey theyve got to make a living in hollywood people wanting to see kiss and lots of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song too bad they might have provided some energy to this mess director adam rifkin knows he hasnt got much material to work with so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning we get an endless parade of quick cuts split screens zoom outs zoom ins and rotating cameras all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script its fun for a while but eventually it becomes disorienting i would recommend that those who felt seasick at the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing on this baby i havent felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since armageddon and what about that script its written by carl j dupr which sounds like as made up a name as ive ever heard if it is i cant say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible a plotless pointless rock n roll movie can be fun if the jokes and gags are actually funny the jokes in detroit rock city rarely are in fact the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana laced pizza and that was just because it was so surreal the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it comedy there is no set up just a succession of punchlines that dont provide for much in the way of chuckles precisely because there was no set up its as if they just whacked someone on the head pointed at him and said see funny look that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink see funny look that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver twice see funny look that kid has been vomiting for minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money see funny a word of advice to mr dupr no these things arent funny all by themselves they must be preceded by a clever set up so the audience hasn t predicted them five minutes in advance thats it ive said enough about this movie its a waste of time and money i liked the music but dont bother buying the soundtrack i hear it s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie you want to see this concept executed well go rent roger cormans classic rock n roll high school it features another late seventies rock band the ramones and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show yes go rent that and skip detroit rock city which will probably bomb and deservedly so, 0
the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes with everything ranging from l a confidential to palmetto to the big lebowski has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran talented directors with this particular genre directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower class and the glamorous opulent upper class while maintaining the noirish ambiguous ambience the staple of film noir wild things could be classified as a black comedy a sultry film noir or a plain ol erotic thriller but the one category it doesnt qualify for is that of a quality motion picture overacted overwrought and overlong wild things is a confused mess a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too with its incalculable twists turns more twists and more turns it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal wild things not once jells in its eroticism unpredictability character motivation sense of the world plot etc theres not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical directed by john mcnaughton henry portrait of a serial killer wild things follows sam lombardo matt dillon a hunkish suburban florida high school teacher whos the dream of every spruced up female in the community particularly one kelly van ryan denise richards adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner soon her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike enabling her to come into his house next thing she cries rape and the so called roller coaster ride ensues a second accuser comes front suzie toller neve campbell a booze drinkin tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen even bill murray gets into the act as lombardos zany lawyer he wears a fake neck brace waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role as ridiculous as it sounds hes the most sane character in the movie the community is astonished reporters flee to the scene theres an million settlement for a libel suit against kellys mother theresa russell theres the ambiguous cop kevin bacon who also executive produced who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit murder and lust we the audience sniff something not so lustful like so many thrillers these days including the usual suspects and the game wild things eschews character for plot mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease as if he knows the territory hes covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany henry a furious unsettling film directorial tour de force george clintons score is a delight to behold but its the humans the characters are mere devices for the nasty twists what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving almost unbearable if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting dont feel real or we dont care for them not even the unintentionally funny moments work the people in wild things are not so much people as they are caricatures then theres the erotic content which nearly earned the film an nc for a sexless badly edited poorly lit menage a trois and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country kevin bacons member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go ironically the wildest elements of wild things are not wild at all, 0
lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode episode is a boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects after the familiar a long time ago opening the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo ruled by queen amidala portman jedi knights qui gon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade however this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park they also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non existent theres no underlying tension and no urgent need to see what the outcome is the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story which doesnt help theres no snap to make the film work it moves at a plod the script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother theres no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders its evident that not much is going to happen the two leads are hideously boring static characters given little to do and too much time to do it qui gon and obi wan hold no presence on film and give little for the audience to root for the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy anakin is annoying and unlikeable instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended its probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the film by him although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a pod racer because i knew he wouldnt be able to talk for a while queen amidala is a nothing in the film she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people and go goo goo over anakin again her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little to do here the actors dont help the movie much either liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy with little charm the casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness theres little other explanation for it natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script but she delivers a spunky performance and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice theres very little talent evident with him its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there hes not even very cute the main claim of the film the special effects are okay theres nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well the cgi takes away much of the human element however the battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers episode is just disappointing its got high production values but little else the music is meandering except near the end the plot gives us no one to root for or even care for the effects are nice but dull the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should theres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich s are catered for throughout the film apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence episode is a dry affair that serves little purpose except to make money and to get us to watch episode to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film disappointing is barely the word rating, 0
rated r for strong violence language drug use nudity and some sexuality starring wesley snipes anne archer michael chaykin donald sutherland marie matiko running time minutes directed by christian duguay ive never fully understood wesley snipess career he has his ups and downs but mostly the downs his best movie was one of the best of and that movie was entitled blade he has had his typical action movies boiling point passenger but his new movie the art of war should just be called rising sun the art of war cause basically its a semi remake of the same plot with a different cast and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller that is high on style and low on substance wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u n after a chinese ambassador is killed he is on the track of the killer trying to find out who it is how it happened where the killer was and what to do anne archer plays his boss type person of the u n and she has hired snipes to track down the killer well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer and is now an outlaw kidnapping a chinese woman with him and having her help him along the way all this leads to a finale that is so dumb and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb and the stunts dialogue and acting all ruin this movie wesley snipes isnt one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before the only good role snipes has really had was in s blade i walked into the art of war expecting a good high octane thriller and all i got was a pile of mush the only real good thing the movie has is action and plenty of it but i noticed it is badly filmed the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful that it even tries to mock the matrix laughably funny it is undeniably stupid christian duguays direction is also not that great his camera angles and sense of style are all in place but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done even the whole matrix ending wasnt even good the stunts and action are badly filmed and badly choreographed his placing of the characters and the assination of the chinese ambassador and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie anne archer who is usually good in her roles turns in a horrible job here she is sour downbeat and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue and dumb moves even donald sutherland as a co star cant save this movie from being a bust so for an overall opinion the art of war is a total waste of time its not entertaining nor exciting or even action packed it is a pointless movie and makes absolutely no sense at all if you really want to see a good version of the art of war rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind rising sun it isnt a great film either but at least its better than this, 0
plot two teen couples go to a church party drink and then drive they get into an accident one of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life and has nightmares whats the deal watch the movie and sorta find out critique a mind fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea but presents it in a very bad package which is what makes this review an even harder one to write since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films and these folks just didnt snag this one correctly they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly so what are the problems with the movie well its main problem is that its simply too jumbled it starts off normal but then downshifts into this fantasy world in which you as an audience member have no idea whats going on there are dreams there are characters coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparitions there are disappearances there are a looooot of chase scenes there are tons of weird things that happen and most of it is simply not explained now i personally dont mind trying to unravel a film every now and then but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again i get kind of fed up after a while which is this films biggest problem its obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes and do they make things entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime not really the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense but it still didnt the make the film all that more entertaining i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding i mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy okay we get it there are people chasing her and we dont know who they are do we really need to see it over and over again how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie apparently the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves and it shows there mightve been a pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere but i guess the suits decided that turning it into a music video with little edge would make more sense the actors are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in a new neighborhood but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who holds her own throughout the entire film and actually has you feeling her characters unraveling overall the film doesnt stick because it doesnt entertain its confusing it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it oh and by the way this is not a horror or teen slasher flick its just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since whatever skip it wheres joblo coming from a nightmare of elm street blair witch the crow the crow salvation lost highway memento the others stir of echoes, 0
a pseudo intellectual film about the pseudo intellectual world of art magazines high art is as wasted as its drug addled protagonists in the only notable part of the movie ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles not that lisa cholodenkos script or direction makes you care much about either character living in a world of heroin induced highs they float along until they fall in love with each other this uninviting picture full of pretentious minor characters has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant year old syd radha mitchell who has a rather bland live in boyfriend was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine frame although the receptionist is impressed syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ally sheedy for her to do photos for frame lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her lucy lives with her current lover a washed up german actress named greta played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope usually heroin this does not happen in a single episode but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture syd who lives in the apartment below them joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs which apparently is funded by her mother lucy quit working professionally years ago since she thought she was being pigeonholed and since her mother has money we can only assume that thats how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographers work is transcendental or merely classical that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny your work has a cultural currency that is important now is the artist speak that the frames manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd her idea of a romantic line is i want to get high with you in lucys world sex and drugs come hand in hand and the movie except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions in another movie it might have worked but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted high art runs it is rated r for explicit sex pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age, 0
a documentary from the twin hughes brothers allen and albert dead presidents menace ii society about street pimps all of whom are african american an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their hos and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be is what you get i learned that the word bitch is their favorite word as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about then some of what they rap about might seem amusing they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money its also a power trip accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place this sleazy pic soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models the feather hatted fur coated diamond ring wearing gold chain wearing flashy cadillac cruising pimp of the late s blaxploitation movies like the mack and willie dynamite also used as reference was iceberg slims best seller pimp the story of my life we meet pimps such as fillmore slim c note charm k red gorgeous dre bishop don magic juan and rosebudd they readily discuss their business arrangements including percentages lifestyles knockin stealing another pimps ho and the thrill they get from women giving them money these dudes needed no prompting to talk as they just love to brag about about themselves priests need nuns yaps c note a san francisco pimp doctors need nurses so hos need pimps as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make that the girls need them to show them the ropes how to make money to be their security blankets protectors and counselors the race issue was brought up right from the films onset as a number of white interviewees regular citizens note that their impression of a pimp is that hes the lowest form of human while we are told in the black community the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur riding around in fancy cars flashing wads of money dressed in a flamboyant style where his snake gaiter shoes might cost him a grand and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery of master and slave relations the film was all about pimp style and their projected image as they run a hard sell riff about the virtues of their work there are different styles of pimping but the film mentions them only as being macks and players or real pimps and perpetrator pimps but no further clarity is attempted it is also failed to get the womens side to this story of abuse primarily taking the pimp at his word the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing hungry for their minutes of fame the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimps wardrobe while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd married his ho and turned square working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer, 0
lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient great acting music and cinematography were nice but too many dull sub plots and characters made the film hard to follow ralph fiennes strange days schindlers list gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy the story revolves around his past in flashback form making it even more confusing anyway he is taken in by hana juliette binoche the horseman on the roof a boring war torn nurse she was never really made into anything until she met an indian towards the end developing yet another sub plot count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger willem dafoe basquiat his love kirstin scott thomas mission impossible was severely injured in a plane crash and eventually died in a cave he returned to find her dead and was heart broken so he flew her dead body somewhere but was shot down from the ground dont get the wrong idea it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting but good is the last thing this film is maybe if it were an hour less it may have been tolerable but hours and minutes of talking is too much to handle the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography other than these the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film, 0
brian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed to kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise with him sadly he forget to bring a good story and believable characters nic cage plays rick santaro a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne sinise an assassination takes place and santaro tries to peace together how it took place trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together however the film doesnt keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the film is at a dead end although there are some fantastic shots by de palma including a minute steadicam shot at the start of the film halfway through the film drops dead the problem is that de palma doesnt have a strong story or characters to work with he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and i quickly got bored nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters but its no use they are boring faceless and completely unlikeable yes another problem with the film is that theres no one to root for were supposed to be on cages side because his character becomes nicer throughout the film however his change is sadly unbelievable poor gary sinises character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way the films use of flashback quickly gets boring while clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go they certainly dont increase the tension or suspense of the movie there is small thread of suspense running through the film but it certainly doesnt make this film a powerhouse thriller rather just a slightly below average one the script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential theres a good story buried in snake eyes its just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks it also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end while the performances are intriguing especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case theres no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance and unless youre a big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided a david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes, 0
over years ago a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankinds nuclear testing partly flight of fancy partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo a year later gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things a new name a dubbed english track and raymond burr as godzilla the film took on the rest of the world thirty years later toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things yes including raymond burr and called it godzilla now its years after tohos remake and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run in emmerichs godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states meanwhile tatopouloss college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works in new york city as an assistant to a big time news reporter shed like to be a reporter herself and when godzilla comes ashore she figures this is her big break of course with the big guy running amok in the city niko and audrey are bound to cross paths and are joined by victor animal palotti hank azaria audreys trusty cameraman friend and phillipe roche jean reno an operative for the french government whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nations premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla he didnt right up there with the lost world godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history the plot is pretty much what we expect the big dinosaur like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city and its up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down the script however is painfully bad its fraught with lines so corny they dont even belong in b movies and includes many character actions which make you think you idiot or you stupid girl i suppose when youve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them but is conveniently able to leap atop others why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line why do sidewinder missiles which have small explosive warheads blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f fighter bombers when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two okay maybe the last one was a bit nit picky but hey i was on a roll broderick is usually a good actor but in this film hes weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way hank azaria does what he can but dont expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage like brodericks azarias character is quite simply lacking in color what really annoyed me was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting casting must have been asleep on this one the one bright spot here is jean reno who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic quite unlike what weve seem him do in the past although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable unfortunately the same cannot be said of the other incongruities the entire feel of the movie is tongue in cheek and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it this results in a significant amount of parody which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster and ends up just producing a mess most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens if we cant take the characters seriously the threat they face is an empty one because we simply dont care what happens to them godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light hearted than it should be far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters but heres a behemoth running through the city theres bound to be a lot of casualties but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after school g i joe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems to get out of harms way just in time in a couple of scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire none of the characters even remark upon this ability nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers its as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes godzilla can do this just like in the old movie consider another punch pulled through creative script writing you can make a sequel out of just about any movie but the final scene in this one doesnt just leave the door open it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently it made me want to gag emmerich should have done away with of the humor and in jokes and played this one as a straight action film with an intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been so much more however by confusing the viewer with a ton of add ins and parodies the movie ends up being something that just doesnt work now if they only had raymond burr, 0

so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci fi films such as close encounters of the third kind a space odyssey apollo and contact well whatever it is youd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange considering the disastrous results were left with here this is a film that takes a little bit of everything but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing its like i said this movie sucks plot a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet critique extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie uneven would be another the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the buzz around it had been so so and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes all leading you to believe that its actually going to go somewhere but it isnt long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry colored planet tries too hard to get us into the pain of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix in a sci fi movie well i dont know much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half only to figure out some big secret in the end a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement ultimately this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise joins the crew in their misadventures in space for the main crux of its journey and eventually settles down for one of the most anti climactic endings this side of contact mind you if you enjoyed that films shrug of the shoulders ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well of course i dont remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story ugh what a friggin mess films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again didnt anybody recognize the crappiness in this script didnt they read the bad dialogue the cheezy lines the obvious derivative nature of the work mind you with a director like depalma at the helm that aint saying much of course you cant really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry oconnell in this fine crew of thespians nuff said neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the films musical score during the last fifteen minutes presumably in order to wake the audience up okay we get it brian this scene is supposed to be powerful wow yawn my ears hurt so is anything salvageable in this movie sure gary sinise does another great job as does cheadle the film doesnt completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sand twister effect that you see in the commercial is well done other than that i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies oops did i say admire i meant am disgusted all in all this movie delivers very little in actual substance offers two bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci fi mumbo jumbo pretends to be deep when really its just sappy and eventually just settles into an ending which other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck go see the ninth gate now theres a great movie and on a personal note i think its time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial minute uninterrupted film sequences and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting, 0
in dreams might keep you awake at night but not because of its creepy imagery bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths no the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movies brutally squandered potential the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise even by tired serial killer genre standards the big letdown however comes upon the realization that this minute head scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan the man behind the crying game hes no stranger to cinematic weirdness but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope things start out strong enough with cinematographer darius khondjis stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film theres even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic seemingly innocent new england autumn but if there ever was a film that didnt deserve so good a polish its this one dont knock the look but say what you will about the foolish plot underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue annette bening another asset in dreams shouldnt be so lucky to boast gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesnt do much for her in return she plays claire cooper a massachusetts childrens book illustrator whos plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible soon to be committed crimes but neither her ho hum husband aidan quinn nor the ho hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously this being a thriller we know that she is in fact on the money and its a credit to benings acting that she delves equally into claires madness and compassion but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims in dreams trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition subplots appear and disappear when claire finally comes face to face with our evil murderer robert downey jr it turns out his name is vivian hes clairvoyant and hes got some major issues with mama a la norman bates in dreams reaches its absurdist zenith here and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists some questions then whats with the garbage disposal retching applesauce are the drawings on the wall blood or paint who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own what about the computer does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan is the woman in australia integral to anything and the aforementioned flooded city what function does that really serve sigh at least in my own dreams i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didnt go to waste, 0
ahh yes the teenage romance an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies and in the end the guy always gets the girl and with the arrival of the breakout hit shes all that last year followed by a long catalogue of imitators including things i hate about you and drive me crazy the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity along now comes down to you the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid shes all that craze with their latest project which has the studdly freddie prinze jr attached and all only down to you doesnt have the unlikely scenario mentioned above it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance a dull unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that were accustomed to this is the kind of romance that only giggly year old girls will find convincing in strictly textbook fashion college sophomore and aspiring chef al prinze jr meets freshman artist imogen julia stiles they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies from here its the standard boy meets girl boy loses girl boy drinks entire bottle of shampoo and may or may not get girl back story the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters who are frequently taking part in activities that well only happen in the movies fortunately the cast of down to you has a certain appeal freddie prinze jr and julia stiles are an adorable couple and when on screen together they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around zak orth as the newly realized porn star monk shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the films intelligent dialogue rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy the faculty selma blair cruel intentions and ashton kutcher tvs that s shows even the fonz himself henry winkler the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia has a welcome role as als dad the host of the popular cooking program chef ray maybe the concept of down to you looked good on paper to draw such a crowd as a feature film however the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely perhaps worst of all down to you is not funny the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired the characters on screen often laughing at each others goofyembarrassing antics seemed far more amused than the audience even the giggly year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run its course the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr in a fantasy sequence called cooks a cops take off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for needy families with the assistance of a fully armed swat team of course when this is the highlight reel you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired in order to make a teen comedy work youve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity things i hate about you actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards and the result was refreshing no such luck with down to you its just a textbook romance where despite absurd circumstances everything is bound to work out in the end and at the end of the whole clich d ordeal the nicest thing you could possibly say would be only in the movies, 0
coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers relentless low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz played by character actor leo rossi spawned three more sequels relentless third in the row features sam dietz again but this time detective who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case doesnt want to deal with similar line of work divorced demoralised and transferred he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer and evidence indicate connection with one of dietzs old cases to make things even more interesting it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation fans of the british tv films and mini series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies they both feature vicious psychopathic killers yet also give a lot of usually depressive details about chief investigators private lives this one isnt an exception but similarities with british television are only in content the execution and style is different which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best useless gratuitous erotica also doesnt help either obviously making this film longer than it should be the actors are good though leo rossi is fine as usual and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career signy coleman as dietzs love interest is on the other hand quite miscast but she wont have to worry about it in the future career since relentless wasnt supposed to be anybodys finest moment anyway, 0
