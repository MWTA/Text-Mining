mpaa not rated though i feel it would likely be pg for martial arts violence with three movies already re released theatrically in america and at least three more on their way jackie chan is one of the newest hot properties in action adventure stardom and its just about time for over twenty five years jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy drunken master has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to make it big this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong im not entirely sure why exactly in many ways drunken master is similar to most of jackies other early films such as fearless hyena i and ii master with cracked fingers half a loaf of kung fu spiritual kung fu and others in fact looking at all these early films together one gets the impression that they were stamped out cookie cutter style at a rate of four to six per year all using the same casts and telling very similar stories to be honest i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste theyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together drunken master though its plot is tighter than some is no exception as an aside drunken master was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen in a movie theater in seattle as part of an asian film festival at the time i didnt really think it was anything special but after having seen more films like it its kind of grown on me drunken master s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies such as fearless hyena i and ii and master with cracked fingers slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh seeming master and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end a formula that has been adapted to put it kindly by american films such as karate kid more specifically jackie chan plays the part of wong fei hong aka naughty panther a fun loving practical joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good but not quite good enough after embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly then beating up a bully in a marketplace wong fei hong tries to hit on a pretty girl but discovers that she and her mother can hit back better than he can and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt respectively his father wong kei ying is unhappy about this and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages kei ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment which fei hong does not like at all while escaping from this punishment fei hong meets up with a drunken old man who proceeds to thrash him soundly then take him on as a student and thrash him some more this turns out to be su hua chi a legendary master of drunken style kung fu he assigns fei hong a series of bizarre tasks such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame cracking walnuts with his hands and other such exercises that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up then when hes ready he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu unfortunately the lazy fei hong only practices six of them drunken master features some wonderful martial arts sequences with jackie winning some fights and losing others its been said before but ill say it again these fights dont just happen theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance and it shows in his fights jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches jugs cups bowls fruits and vegetables often in new and surprising ways the fight scenes particularly those toward the end of the film are unparallelled in most american films whether jackie wins or loses its really something to see and its often as funny as anything too and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very very good at theres very little thats new in this movie jackie winning fights jackie getting beaten badly by a master jackie going through punishment or training these schticks have all been seen before in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties but theyre still hilarious as ever likewise jackie has a great supporting cast many of whom were also in other early jackie films and theyre often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own the really big thing about drunken master though that inspired several copycats including a couple starring jackie himself and a sequel fifteen years later was the drunken style kung fu im not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security and it apparently helps if youre drunk while youre doing it genuine or not i have to admit theres just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whats going on come to think of it perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films its not just martial arts its the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go whoa on the negative side the cinematography in this film is nothing special the film stock is rather primitive the plot is often rather slow and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background gone with the wind this isnt still if you like martial arts films or like what youve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more give it a shot its much more real than chuck norris or jean claude van damme you might very well like it another interesting thing about drunken master has to do with its video availability in the us drunken master is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available on vhs from magnum video in a gold box for about there are plenty of other early jackie films around but these are typically either in dubbed pan and scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase thankfully drunken master at least is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen at a very affordable price if you like drunken master take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there even the dubbed ones arent really too bad if nothing else you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue i particularly recommend spiritual kung fu half a loaf of kung fu the fearless hyena movies and snake crane arts of shaolin also the mostly unrelated storywise sequel drunken master ii will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year though what its american release title will be is still uncertain and comes highly recommended by this reviewer also for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei hong who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ive been told to suggest the once upon a time in china series starring jet li though i havent personally seen any of them yet if you choose to watch drunken master i really hope you enjoy it and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema thats out there all in all i give this film an, 1
robert benton has assembled a stellar mature cast for his latest feature twilight a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames gene hackman and susan sarandon a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight when jack sends him on a routine delivery job however the old instincts kick in soon harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line and he no longer knows who to trust there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight in addition to newman hackman and sarandon james garner plays raymond hope a former cop and one of harrys best friends stockard channing plays verna harrys former partner and possibly a former love interest reese witherspoon is mel the distrustful daughter of the ames and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend giancarlo esposito appears as harrys bumbling detective protigi and john spencer is a suspicious police captain with a cast like that its almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze luckily theres more to the film than some sort of actors recognition ceremony twilight has a solid film noir ish plot it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days the major cast members all deliver strong performances as can be expected of their caliber however none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable the supporting cast is enjoyable if a little underdrawn stockard channings character in particular is a cipher theres more to her character than the film takes the time to describe its a minor but irritating flaw with a solid cast and a good plot theres a lot to recommend about twilight its biggest flaw is actually its short running time at a slim minutes theres a lot of stuff thats packed into an awfully small package still the chance to see newman sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two, 1
after watching rat race last week i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that when not laughing aloud i had held a grin for virtually all of the films minutes saturday night i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didnt enjoy it as much the second time as the first rat race is a great goofy delight a dandy mix of energetic performances inspired sight gags and flat out silliness hands down this is the most fun film of the summer the movie begins with zippy retro style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a s slapstick comedy featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky jerky bodies bounding around the screen then comes the setup donald sinclair john cleese the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients to that end he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines gathering together the lucky token holders he explains today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six the competition is simple each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city n m containing million in cash there is a transmitter in every key so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead the race has no rules whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes lets use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers decked out in flashy trashy clothing and sporting big hair vera baker whoopi goldberg is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby she finds that grown up merrill lanai chapman is erudite conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life thrown together it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature owen templeton cuba gooding jr is currently the most hated man in america an nfl referee he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high profile game after escaping from a vengeful cab driver owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention mr pollini rowan atkinson is a cheerful odd little italian man on holiday in america he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times pollini hitches a ride with zack wayne knight a hyper tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation randy pear jon lovitz promised his wife beverly kathy najimy and two kids a fun filled vacation in las vegas fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview beverly insists the family stay together so they hop in the mini van and tear off into the desert brothers duane seth green and blaine vince vieluf cody are young crooked and stupid blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self done tongue piercing and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal finally nick shaffer breckin meyer is a no nonsense lawyer in training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet amy smart for the journey at first glance they seem blandly wholesome but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn dean cain and spies him swimming with another woman director jerry zucker airplane ghost leaps from racer to racer periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr grisham dave thomas his personality impaired right hand man continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers as with any zucker production a few jokes fall flat but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay off had i been part of the filmmaking team i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a babys clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm inducing hint of child molestation i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence my god do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing all star but enough carping rat race is a riot with terrific no holds barred performances from the diverse cast see it see it again and when the dvd comes out buy it because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for, 1
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric ostensibly the film is a documentary but use of that term requires stretching its meaning many scenes appear staged and a great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room the cinema verite effect is a conceit genuine spontaneity is at a premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially would be actresses like cindy crawford director douglas keeve who was mizrahis lover at the time freely admits that he couldnt care less about the truth but was more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion despite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment while it sheds only a little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry it presents a fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study hes funny energetic and eminently quotable he has unusual views on just about everything from fashion its about women not wanting to look like cows to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style its almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress its almost certainly different that anyone would imagine the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection in particular unzipped traces mizrahis development of his fall line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlights a number of prominent models including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista on the technical side a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped a variety of film stocks were used super mm black and white and mm color there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audiences perspective while black and white is for the behind the scenes sequences nevertheless some viewers will be put off by this treatment while unzipped isnt an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear overall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed when the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes thats beautiful and liberating it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed, 1
since the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style now instead of emphasizing feel good stories replete with characters of noble virtues the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times as s schindlers list shows most of todays mainstream drama however creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience thats why pictures like october sky which are a throwback to the good ol dramas of yesteryear are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam jake gyllenhaal a teenager in the s company town of coalwood west virginia its a well known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships the rest grow up to work in the coal mine the mine which is run by homers father chris cooper is not the place for homer however after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in homer feels a connection with the outside world as he puts it anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast homer begins to construct rockets with the help of their history teacher miss riley laura dern and several mine workers the four are soon bound for great things october sky is a skillfully crafted film and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston johnston whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars certainly knows what hes doing here he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust he does not push any barriers but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the films charm his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers or the silent struggle between homers mother and father the cast is well chosen although the true bright spots are the supporting roles laura dern jurassic park lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher giving the boys the support and guidance they need her role is instantly likeable chris cooper the horse whisperer as homers father is less likeable even downright despicable at times but his turn here gives gravity to the movie hes definitely a driving force in homers life and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable the script is generally cheerful projecting the boys endeavors in a lighthearted manner there are moments when it becomes predictable such as the train tracks scene and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist it highlights the essence of youth however and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps october sky should be a success with audiences although it doesnt have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or shes all that it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards its a welcome change to the dramatic genre and one that everyone should see, 1
youve got mail works alot better than it deserves to in order to make the film a success all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in its body its basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner only adding a few modern twists essentially it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking its overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy not to mention very manipulative but oh how enjoyable that manipulation is but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does because i absolutely hated the previous ryanhanks teaming sleepless in seattle it couldnt have been the directing because both films were helmed by the same woman i havent quite yet figured out what i liked so much about youve got mail but then again is that really important if you like something so much why even question it again the storyline is as cliched as they come tom hanks plays joe fox the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run childrens book shop called in a nice homage the shop around the corner fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business little do they know they are already in love with each other over the internet only neither party knows the other persons true identity the rest of the story isnt important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen sure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship all of this of course leads up to the predictable climax but as foreseeable as the ending is its so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love i was filled with such for lack of a better word happiness that for the first time all year i actually left the theater smiling, 1
i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory this was of course a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this not only did i get to see an advance screening i was able to see an advance screening of a very good movie the very fast paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher a fast talking witty comical taxi driver in new york city gibsons performance is terrific and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films gibson again teams up with richard donner as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick and this time around the combination works even better the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique try to imagine a toned downed version of travis bickle who this time around is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover ups if you can imagine that then youve basically got jerry fletcher in many ways i was surprised by this movie to begin with i was surprised at how good it was dont get me wrong its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring but it was a very enjoyable movie secondly i was surprised at mel gibsons performance he provided a fantastic performance the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all out action flick which after viewing it was almost the opposite in a certain sense gibsons character has an almost uncountable number of one liners hilarious situations and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film for instance jerrys apartment and especially his security is memorable and last i was surprised at how good the plot is writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story and when watching this film you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers far fetched or so they seem at first conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions mel gibson isnt the only stand out in the film julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton the department of justice employee who cant seem to stay away from jerry fletcher who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories he also seems obsessed and in love with her but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories she shrugs him and his beliefs off continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him jerry obviously determined to continually seek out the truth continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory which will be printed in his newsletter same title as the movie although he only has five subscribers he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work and publishes his next edition very soon after he does so he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr jonas patrick stewart after barely escaping alive jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust alice sutton the remainder of the film is almost always fast paced and full of action and suspense with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy and more along the way the audience and alice learn more and more about jerrys life many things are explained throughout this film both to the characters and to the audience for instance the meaning of the book the catcher in the rye and its ties to assassins the reason lone gunmen have three names e g lee harvey oswald and james earl ray and the real truth behind the grateful dead make sure listen closely throughout the film as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above definitely when conspiracy theory hits theaters august th make sure you are standing in line to see it i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film especially if you are into an action thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations and even if you arent you should still like this film, 1
one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsys wedding and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald who hasnt made a worthwhile film since but the fact is betsys wedding is also an alan alda film and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life written and directed by alda betsys wedding is a vibrant slice of life mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor aldas comic elixir is smooth and refreshing and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare as bride and groom molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film but they are by far the least interesting walsh is a nonentity with all the screen presence of a door knob ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair red lip stick and grotesque outfits shes supposed to be a dress designer but she looks more like a clown and to make matters worse ringwalds performance matches her appearance thankfully alda keeps ringwalds screen time to a minimum he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters the wedding is just a device to bring together the brides working class italian family and the grooms rich gentile family ringwalds folks are homey and down to earth with alda as her free spirited father madeline kahn as her practical mother and ally sheedy as her lonely sister walshs clan on the other hand is prim proper and ostentatious when the two families meet and mingle the movie becomes a story of culture clash or as one character puts it money versus values ally sheedy in a wonderfully understated performance is one of the films most pleasant surprises sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body its anthony lapaglia however who seizes the spotlight lapaglia plays stevie dee a suave overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry lapaglias sincere but dim witted character is a riot and whats uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role model and partly a rip off i dont know whether to say a star is born or a star is re born but i do know that lapaglias over the top performance should not be missed the scrumptious comic acting however extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia joe pesci in particular sinks his teeth into his role as aldas unscrupulous brother in law a slum lord with mob ties who is cheating on his wife catherine ohara alda faced with challenge of both directing and acting somehow finds just the right comic touch as the brides financially strapped father a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet the film adopts aldas psychological point of view as he tries to one plan the wedding and two pay for it as a filmmaker aldas style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful and while he doesnt have the comic genius of a woody allen alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy, 1
many people dislike french films for their lack of closure while possibly shallow ive often had a desire for a sense of epiphany or at least a resolution in the films which i view there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional however the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion denying protagonist stephane daniel auteuil stephane daniel auteuil is a master violin maker he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing even the relationship between he and his boss maxime andre dussollier is a controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches in the beginning of the movie stephane is a closed solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man camille kessler emmanuelle beart is a master violinist and the new love of maximes maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife like stephane camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges when stephane and camille meet there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals however whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him stephane ignores his feelings for camille which the audience cannot help but to see is present as the movie progresses the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another these two people with very similar approaches to life initially react to their new circumstance very differently stephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship however their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well due to his relationship with a master violin teacher however apparently he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing consequently stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays in contrast camille had almost given the violin years earlier however with the aid of her manager she has progressed to being almost one of the worlds finest successfully submerging herself to her playing during the course of the movie we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions stephane attempts to remain unchanged however we do see subtle hints of his transformation one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash the development of all of the characters many of which is not included in this synopsis is incredible american movies with rare exceptions have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development in its essence this movie is about the development and growth of the characters camille and stephane the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie including a death is to further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters i am not sure why berardinelli says at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified and it is to auteuils credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty this movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are i find the ending appropriate unfortunately i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling this portion of the film is where the sense of closure could have been successfully accomplished unfortunately there is a hurried and almost a soap opera type surge of emotions from all of the characters while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart ravel has his day in this film the synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen the directing in this movie is wonderful the actors and actresses are excellent each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth emmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful and needless to say i must say that emmanuelle beart herself is beautiful besides the near ending the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot has their attitude towards love changed i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at but i am unsure of which the director is espousing in summary this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship in the process we see their attitude towards life and other people in itself i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we as americans have preconceived american notions of relationship love and people i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture however i bringing my american preconceptions enjoyed the film i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it, 1

call for the cliche police if you must but the eyes are the window to the soul the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze paul newman ralph fiennes anthony hopkins morgan freeman you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds that the characters they play are real human beings we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor but he had that unique quality in his eyes in gridlockd an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire shakur and his co star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry shakur and roth play ezekiel spoon whitmore and alexander stretch rome two detroit buddies who share a spoken wordjazz trio an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie thandie newton when a new years eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time they soon make a new years resolution to get into rehab but that proves to be easier said than done as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy confusion and red tape the government might be the least of their obstacles however as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer and on the run from a nasty thug vondie curtis hall in order for you to buy into gridlockd at all you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government offices on new years day in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all gridlockd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey s falling down which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles in falling down michael douglas d fens the characters personalized license plate echoed in gridlockd by the drug lord d repers plates whips out a gun because he cant get breakfast at mcdonalds in gridlockd spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center and where the unhinged d fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences writerdirector vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just because you picked today to clean up the world in gridlockd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them a significant chunk of gridlockd is devoted to spoon and stretchs flight from d reper and from the police and those sub plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments in one scene stretch scares off d reper by getting chummy with a police officer another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the films main events perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self destructive behavior oh the irony of it tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case and living the life to back it up in gridlockd shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction mostly it comes through those eyes eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta it is spoon who plays conscience to stretchs pure appetite and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self destructiveness he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again which is as much an obstacle to spoons goal as any agency or enemy gridlockds most cruelly comic scene finds stretch helping spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him with friends like that spoon doesnt need enemies and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much the tragedy now is that we wont get more chances to see those eyes again, 1
by phil curtolo mel gibson braveheart gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howards ransom gibson plays tom mullen a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath played by gary sinise forrest gump and his band of low life thugs kidnap his only son for million tom and his wife kate played by rene russo tin cup were instructed not to inform the police but they contacted the fbi minutes later an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo broken arrow are in toms house and wiring every phone the plot sounds average just like most other kidnap movies that youve already seen and it was nothing more than that that is until about half way through the movie suddenly tom goes to the fox news room and makes a live broadcast saying this is your ransom but this is as close as you will ever get to it instead i am offering this money as a reward on your head dead or alive at this point the plot thickened and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense filled action film with great stunts the last half of the film is very well done another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones before this movie sinise played mostly good guys first in of mice men then in forrest gump and most recently in apollo but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop gone bad gibson of course was just being gibson in an oscar worthy performance although most of the scenes were quite predictable ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film, 1
meet joe black reviewed on nov starring brad pitt anthony hopkins claire forlani in meet joe black brad pitt plays death thats all that really needs to be said but nevertheless i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description death decides to take a holiday what with all the rigors of soul collecting and all and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what its like to be human death assumes the body of brad pitt and from there much trouble ensues for one thing death as pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter played by claire forlani obviously this enrages hopkins because really what can death offer besides eternal damnation of course there is also a sub plot about forlanis ex boyfriend she dumps him for pitt trying to take over hopkins company meet joe black runs just under three hours ive always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics meet joe black is neither historical nor is it an epic though i get the feeling martin brest the director desperately wants it to be every single scene in the movie goes on about minutes too long and the ending takes about minutes longer than it really should a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent instead of just good which is what it is pitt an actor i normally loathe is actually quite engaging as death i believed his performance and i could see why forlanis character would fall in love with him i have to agree with roger ebert though who found it hard to believe that an entity thats been around for all time wouldnt know what peanut butter was that has nothing to do with pitts performance of course but it is a little distracting hopkins gives his usual excellent performance hes able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left without making him an obnoxious whiner and in her first major studio role claire forlani is surprisingly good she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her so meet joe black is a good movie hampered by its ridiculous running time had the film been cut by an hour or so i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review, 1
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer  professor with such lived in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid s in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world youd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good natured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open in wonder boys his performance isnt showy or a tour de force its simple yet truthful he embodies grady a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms grady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy their target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges hes portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is a little too calculated he reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white leer is similar a guy who equates quirks with depth tobey maguire fits well in the role with his round sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude but unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to hes a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility katie holmes plays hannah a beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in gradys pants this is a plot line i had trouble with douglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe its because im jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth then i think of douglass real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and im pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas there is a movie in there somewhere grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell a droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor okay maybe not so chivalrous there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says she was a junkie for the printed word lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice robert downy j r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual hes arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance the actor is perfectly cast here and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor i wish wonder boys had more of him searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but thats part of its charm and maybe im a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia a place im greatly fond of and a place rarely explored in american cinema everyone has a sub genre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen to be privy to im privy to films about literary types i e those individuals enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points sometimes the dialogue is too clever but thats a problem i wish i found with films more often another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins to open up for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as a low key comedy for its chuckle worthy throwaway gags the gags are like those in the great robert altman m a s h the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isnt ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things curtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated to more meaningful films he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in a wonder boys party it fits the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen its the cinematic equivalent to a good read novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies many will find it slight but i found much to savor among its subtleties, 1

logical time travel movies are a near impossibility considering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task occasionally we get a film that does manage it terry gilliams monkeys was one such film but more frequently we get films that dont much deal with it at all there is one question to ask in this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies the terminator films made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own is frequency filled with plot holes yes does it matter not really the film opens in october of firefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson the double pronged story flashes forward to where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as a police detective a strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in and that john has found in the present day though both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women frank and john now must work together to set things right with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past the premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions this isnt explained you just have to go with it when frank doesnt die in a fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities and are to each other sometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time now the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if i thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations arent really the point when frequency gets cooking its a riveting little thriller even if it is confusing what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved i liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward it actually uses the mets orioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him admittedly this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself i even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods some may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script a lot of leeway and lets face it its a darn cool way to end the film there are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency to keep you on your toes and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant the other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the father son relationship quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily its a rock solid job from both actors the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative or with a future descendant watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we dont believe in the characters we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot here we do care because we like the lead actors i also liked some of the supporting cast members elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably andre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives a nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused perhaps the only thing i didnt like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard but thats only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics i freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as a guy movie since it focuses on the very male oriented idea of father son relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable who wouldnt want to speak with a long dead parent or see how their children turn out tell me about your life son excuse me while i mist up and dont call me a sissy, 1
one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy innocent fun sometimes the stories are compelling sometimes theyre not but with the exception of the first film in the series which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ive never been bored by any of the enterprises numerous missions star trek insurrection is no exception the film has gotten some negative reviews a friend of mine actually thinks its the worst in the series but im not really sure why its an exciting often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film some say its a bit too light and more of a long episode than a film others say the special effects are cheesy and that its boring i simply enjoyed the film insurrection which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast introduces us to a race of people called the baku the baku are very old most of them are about three hundred years old but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet of course these peaceful people cant horde this fountain of youth all for themselves leave it up to their archenemies the sona led by ruafo f murray abraham to mess everything up the sona who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable strike a deal with the federation to move the baku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying thats when captain picard patrick stewart steps in he realizes that moving the baku would kill them it also helps that he falls in love with a baku woman donna murphy so with his trusty crew picard defies the federation to keep the baku in their natural habitat when dealing with a series with as much history as this its not entirely necessary to re introduce your characters with each episode this is why i believe non fans have a hard time getting into star trek in order to enjoy it one has to understand how to approach it insurrection however does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters stewart is bold as always a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together jonathan frakes who also directed is funny as commander riker a subplot with data brent spiner discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact insurrection is an exciting film with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation and the result is very pleasing to the eye particularly in the climactic scenes in which the sona employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the baku planet the special effects have a clean impressively sharp look if i have any complaint about the film its that it tries to take a moral stance when its not very appropriate to do so i dont think its that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move baku in order to save the lives of thousands better yet why couldnt they have co existed insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience with its inherent camp factor the star trek series doesnt seem well equipped to deal with issues like this i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle, 1
dora fernanda montenegro sits behind a make shift desk at rios major train station she in her colorful demeanor offers a service that is unheard of in the states she writes letters for the illiterate who pass through to try to find lost relatives find love or search after lost debts shes quirky shes elderly shes caring totally trustworthy right not a chance once home she never sends these letters saving money on postage and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene mar lia p ra one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine year old son looking for their father shortly thereafter she gets hit by a bus and the son is orphaned days go by and the boy named josu roams around the station hungry desperate and somewhat clueless to his predictament through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu s father this means leaving the security of rio traveling to the outskirts of brazil where unpaved roads religious devotees and the poverty stricken become commonplace films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world so distant from my own it does so entertainingly and so heart wrenchingly and yet its backdrop is merely that the focus is on the minute transformation of dora of how she learns to love this little kid without being cloying or sentimental the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film dora being an amoral scam artist could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle lighting of the catholics versus the bumper sticker mentality of the evangelicals but neither side is trivialized she even begins to develop an affection for a non drinking evangelical who sees the problems with dora if not initially fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira who plays josu he like the discoveries of j r mie renier la promesse and giorgio cantarini life is beautiful prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states he is a natural and never once grating send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas, 1
the truman show paramount pictures running time hour minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait jim carreys dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen in case youve been asleep for the last few months the plot centres on truman burbank carrey who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven his life seems so perfect however because its controlled by christoff harris creator of the truman show the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of thats right burbanks life is being broadcast live to the american public and seahaven and all its inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far with an idea so different it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator luckily the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie talking of carrey hes perfect in this movie enjoying the best role in his career his character is a re inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask and is completely suited to carreys persona he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode shrieking and being silly but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey hes not completely dramatic like the film promises however ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff the megalomaniac creator of the show quiet and well spoken he burns an image into the viewer unfortunately hes barely in the film and for the first hour dosent appear at all also disappointing is natascha mcelhones character sylvia she plays the role well but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her the supporting cast is excellent and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect so perfect its creepy the philip glass soundtrack is also superb and is used to great effect during the film peter weir keeps the film going clearly having fun the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card although it is slightly slow to begin with about half an hour into film the pace really picks up and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll sadly though the film is practically over when the film is in full steam also concerning the ending it is slightly too ambiguous which was disappointing the screenwriter andrew niccol who bought us gattaca delivers an entertaining script and manages to keep the plot in trim while christoffs plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly they never go over the line which would have been easy for niccol to do also theres some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show overall the truman show is excellent entertainment certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces it should be viewed by everyone it offers something to every member of the audience and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed overall rating review by david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes, 1
i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter there is one small quake then another quake then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in hours a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall then it starts the volcanic eruption i liked this movie but it was not as great as i hoped i was still good none the less it had excellent special effects the best view the helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos also there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting so it was good, 1
footloose has only one goal in mind to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel good antics and i hate to admit it i fell for it the movie is about a teenager bacon who moves to a small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend lithgow he ends up falling for the preachers daughter singer and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do as mentioned at the beginning of this review footloose is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama there are virtually no surprises and the writing is second rate so why did i enjoy it so much for one thing the cast is great kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role were rooting for him right from the start and unlike most films of this genre bacon doesnt play him as the rebel without a clue sort yes he does rebel but hes also polite when he needs to be and he never broods the rest of the cast is equally impressive john lithgow seen here playing a normal guy for a change is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter by the end of the film we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character another nice touch is the music we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with sexual innuendos but thats not true at all the title track performed by kenny loggins is upbeat and fun during the final sequence i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing of course i soon realized that would be a little pathetic anyway footloose is a charming little surprise dont let the premise prevent you from watching it it sucked me in and itll do the same to you, 1
minor plot spoilers in review no major spoilers are in review the previous two alien films have each had their own unique styles to them the ridley scotts alien was very much a stylistic suspense film james camerons aliens was much more of an action film and i liked each film separately for which it was now alien is out and it is its own film in the same right that alien and aliens were unlike aliens alien requires that you have seen aliens this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off the survivors of the expedition to lv are returning home after battling and beating the aliens the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item an egg in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch find its quarry which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel this vessel crash lands on fury everyone in the vessel is killed except ripley the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash fury is an ex miningmaximum security prison when closed down some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years ripleys arrival sparks a problem with the inmates as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoners sport there is an infestation of lice on the planet being an ex prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own i will not go into detail but you can guess what happens here the alien is loose and no one believes ripleys outstanding story she finds comfort in the arms of the colonys doctor yes after years ripley has sex it is not gratuitous in fact we dont even see them kiss but it is just as well a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film there is a lot more gore in alien in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien than either of the earlier two it also sports a new alien with legs i wont say how but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle which i am sure will be explored in alien sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination the rest of the cast is also quite good notably charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury alien has a very distinct look this is due largely to its director david fincher mr fincher who until now has only directed music videos and commercials has done an incredible job here his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no alien film has before for mr fincher i see a long prosperous career ahead of him the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the alien series been set in this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii james horners aliens this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring this is a great score the ending to alien is quite good there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up but it played very nicely i will not ruin the ending for you go see the film i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season alien is a worthy successor to aliens and alien and when they make alien perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in, 1
wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon denise richards and neve campbell that deals with all the issues sex love murder and betrayal the setting of the film is a town named blue bay it consists of many swamps and slums and on the other hand rich estates owned by the towns different benefactors the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the towns ritzy expensive high school it is here that we meet all of the core characters theres guidance counselor sam lombardo police officers ray duquette and gloria perez dark mysterious senior suzie toller and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor but none more than kelly throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape shortly after suzie too confesses that sam raped her as well this pushes kellys sex craving mother sandra to stop at nothing until sam is convicted during the trial kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her however it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor after sam is cleared kellys mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her it is then revealed that sam kelly and suzie were all in on it together it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda matt dillon stars as sam lombardo sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage he isnt the obvious best of actors but dillon does give a convincing performance however his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles although he never had many to start out with in the first place neve campbell who most people relate to scream and scream plays blue bay outcast suzie toller suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film campbell is very successful with this character adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch playing kelly van ryan is denise richards kelly is your typical rich sexy head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses like her sexpot mother sandra one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother denise richards still hot off the press from starship troopers gives the most interesting performance in the entire film in the beginning kelly looks to be a paper thin character but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy but dominating as well kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette this character looks to be one of the most boring predictable in the film however it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story still the film doesnt seem to gain much from bacons performance only his name in the supporting cast theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan daphne rubin vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez and bill murray shines as sams lawyer ken bowden hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller the eroticism which is portrayed with good taste is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with its share of twists, 1
the long kiss goodnight r meryl streep tried it and failed even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well bared assets however geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband renny harlin davis plays samantha caine a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey samuel l jackson she slowly remembers and reclaims her past as charly baltimore tough as nails cia operative needless to say with the reappearance of samanthacharly comes the appearance of an assortment of no goodniks out to erase more than her memory shane black netted a cool mil for his script im not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag but for what its worth it delivers the goods like blacks previous work such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny quirky dialogue the humor especially works well in this case for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously but theres no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car while ice skating jackson and davis make a good team jackson is funny as ever as ever in fact his spirited line deliveries especially when he first appears are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction as good as he is the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis who shows much promise as an action heroine what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesnt take herself too seriously she is obviously in on the joke slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation this is not to say that she doesnt need work sometimes she lays on the toughness a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature but should the public embrace the film and in turn the notion of a kick ass female davis could have found her special niche it seems as if davis and harlins first collaboration the middling pirate epic cutthroat island was just a dress rehearsal albeit a very costly one for long kiss in which the wife husband team hit their action stride anyone simply looking for a fun escapist entertainment that requires little to no thinking will find this film to be a more than welcome kiss, 1
if theres one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively its obvious theres no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production its a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no thought movie quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen the story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statement making in the cinema not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite a bit of luck find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named pleasantville maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudo world but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the father knows best times its not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in a quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is a soda shop owner turned painter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is a close minded mayor j t walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town fine performances are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j t walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy for daniels its his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh its a complementary exclamation point on a fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish theres not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who dont, 1
crazybeautiful suffers from the damned if you do damned if you dont syndrome after a spate of flighty cookie cutter teen films the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story but rather than applaud the production early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown afterschool special even worse in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people the studio got a case of the heebie jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re shoot scenes and cut footage to tone things down needless to say the filmmaker was frustrated we were trying to make a cautionary tale he told newsweek and we couldnt show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from regardless the film works thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes crazybeautiful is quality fare good enough that i half expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes set in pacific palisades calif the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens every morning and evening carlos nunez jay hernandez takes a two hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school an honor student and star athlete carlos is responsible modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy all is well until he meets nicole oakley kirsten dunst the daughter of a rich congressman bruce davison nicole is a drunk apparently hell bent on self destruction carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her but he is only human and she has the greatest smile plus as her father notes she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral as with save the last dance crazybeautiful god how i hate lower case titles takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh while noting the racial and social differences between the kids the screenplay dances around most of the clich s there are still several mtv moments though the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there cute as a button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicoles behavior she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down i hoped the boy would listen as carlos hernandez is a revelation hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team the young man can really act we will see a lot of this guy in the future aside from its title the biggest problem with crazybeautiful is its ending which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy after carefully presenting credible characters and situations the conclusion feels rushed and lazy still this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots afterschool special my ass crazybeautiful is the real deal, 1
why do so many childrens films treat their target audience with utter contempt too many of those who write or direct for childrens movies assume that the kids just cant handle serious thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues the iron giant which was directed and co written by brad bird late of such animated series as the simpsons and king of the hill assumes that not only can children handle such discussions but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time the iron giant holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience making it a film thats enjoyable for both children and adults alike hogarth hughes voice of eli marienthal is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard working single mother annie jennifer aniston in a small town in maine after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception he comes across a giant robot vin diesel from space that eats metal for food after saving the robot nicknamed the iron giant from electric shock hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts because of damage he suffered upon landing the giant has forgotten what his original mission was so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy realizing he cant just keep the giant in a barn all the time and that the giant needs food he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean harry connick jr an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth cant keep the giant a secret forever because a government spook named kent mansley christopher mcdonald has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant and takes up residence in hogarths house as a lodger meanwhile the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind the iron giant is exactly what family films ought to be because it doesn t talk down to its audience the story is simple very simple about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy its very similar to the spielberg classic e t and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of the iron giant the film holds many of the better elements of spielbergs film such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy the film delivers several serious messages the most important of which is ones ability to choose ones own fate hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be a hero the final sequence is touching and appropriate though i wont give it away i will say that very few will be disappointed the animation while not up to disney standards what could be after tarzan is good enough to make you forget youre watching a cartoon the giant is computer animated while the human characters are all hand drawn the old fashioned way the characters faces are done quite well drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother harry connick jr does a nice characterization as dean and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney of tvs frasier as an army general called in by agent mansley unlike several cartoon features each character is actually a developed personality rather than a stereotype and is actually integral to the plot rather than being a superfluous comic relief sidekick a clich disney still hasnt ditched dean for example could have been a stereotypical beatnik his character profile seems to suggest that but he is presented as a character with real emotions thoughts and motivations even the heavy agent mansley is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to but out of his own fear and paranoia a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper thin stereotypes and figure the kids wont mind but the iron giant has clearly put a little work into making the characters real and it pays off the film isnt only around to deliver heavy handed messages though its also very funny and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things such as dive into a pool are handled well and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing having worked on the simpsons for many years a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to outlast one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed and also extremely clever the film even takes some jabs at americas nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to duck and cover in the event of a nuclear attack the iron giant has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing instead of seeing people get bonked on the head we get well timed clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with when you get right down to it the iron giant is no more than the story of a boy and his robot the story is so straightforward so quaint that it ultimately becomes charming though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person when it comes to family entertainment simple is the way to go its akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word but its not the story that sets the film above others of its kind but rather the elements that go into the story namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue which the iron giant has in spades, 1

after having heard so many critics describe return to me as an old fashioned hollywood romance i kept asking myself going into this movie what exactly is an old fashioned hollywood romance what made return to me old fashioned and old hollywood was it the tunes from sinatra etc legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on was it the glamorous sophisticated feel the charisma of the two leads even now i cant say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer because i havent see that many old fashioned hollywood romances i dont think any of the romances ive seen have been classified as such which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics return to me was old fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider it was traditional magical we knew it couldnt be too daring or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity tenderness and love from director bonnie hunt that it couldnt help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunts direction from the very first birds eye view of chicago zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland david duchovny accompanied by the return to me ballad by whom we can tell were in for something sweet the scenes between the characters are endearing truthful with just a hint of fantasy real people dont act that way real people arent that nice we know all this and yet we want to believe in these folks existence the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale but hunts rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal everything is ordinary yet beautiful in this film from the festive little family restaurant to grace minnie driver and bobs wardrobes from the eloquent not in a hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen the most beautiful part return to me has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist we care for them laugh with them cry with them were concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father whatever hunt did she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors disappointingly david alan griers charlie however much i like him was the most flatly written duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona with the help of his fellow co stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of the x files duchovny who is excellent at understatement and self deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer though an unlikely pair duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses while return to me functions remarkably as a laugh out loud comedy a romantic scenic tour through chicago and a tearjerker the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wifes heart we already know that theres going to be a happy ending we feel like we spend the entire film however enjoyably in a straight line going towards that point as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly yes i know shes supposed to have his ex wifes heart and everything it seems too effortless the main subject is a love story and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters whose story might not have that much meat after all however in the spirit of return to me it wont do to be too picky about how old hollywood tells its stories i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt it shows the bottom line return to me is nothing remarkable and yet its sweetness sincerity and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadnt imagined, 1

plot a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon to whom hes devoted a tribute band in which he sings gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place critique im a sucker for movies like this a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams works hard devotes the time the energy and the patience and ultimately hits it big time in the case of this film our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it yup luck always finds its way into these types of equations although generally tied very closely to hard work they need a new singer his entry and adaptation to the whole rock n roll lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love or past love of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isnt that prominent anymore i still check out my motley crue twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again thats not to say that you wont like this film if you dont like the music but the music and live performances from the band play a big part in the movie and i for one had a blast watching and listening to it all but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg wow hand this fella some major props as he totally becomes this heavy metal geekgod incidentally metal god was the films original title and a much better one if you ask me he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend and the romance angle between them was sweet but she didnt pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes i was also impressed by some of the real musicians who played in the film zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne jeff pilson from dokken stephan jenkins from third eye blind blas elias from slaughter but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members its to note that this film was based on a real life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer their original singer also admitted to being gay as in this film just for the record im certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies but because its a fun uplifting well paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances oh yeah and for those who dig the heavier side of music the soundtrack also rocks you see dreams can come true wheres joblo coming from almost famous blow boogie nights detroit rock city girlfight goodfellas, 1
we run tings tings dont run we sound advice from capone paul campbell to his squaddie or partner floyd winston bell jamaican film shot entirely on video featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo styled brotherhood morals and a little gunplay capone a tough as nails super cop gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home while he was with his lady and killed his partner in front of him when he arrives he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and much to his disappointment also finds out his childhood friend ratty mark danvers has been helping him torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films although the action isnt as hyperkinetic as most of woos films are the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though and eventually begin to take on a life of their own beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after the make up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well with flawless squib work on display from the effects team the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue spoken with thick jamaican accents half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang just adds to the interest paul campbell as the loose cannon capone essays his role perfectly displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together unfortunately carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective largely because his underlings seem to run all over him but then again that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists sly and robbie who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones maxi priest bob dylan james brown grace jones herbie hancock bootsy collins and carly simon among others the end credit song we run tings by the group red dragon is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review oddly enough desmond ballentine who plays the character deportee is well known as a pioneer in the realm of gangsta reggae as the performer ninjaman and he doesnt contribute a single song to the film that i could see which is virtually unheard of here in the us at the time of this writing third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us coming off of a six month box office breaking run in jamaica where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time bringing in million in jamaica which is roughly us palm pictures the company that released the offbeat but entertaining six string samurai is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters chris blackwell founder of palm pictures was also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in entitled countryman so id say he has a pretty good track record overall third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo ringo lam tsui hark and many other action films by directors from hong kong if action films are your thing and you dont mind intermittent subtitles then you cant go wrong with this film the performances and the story are solid if only a little cliched and the action is tight im not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like but apparently third world cops honors are well deserved, 1
when bulworth ended i allowed myself a sigh of relief it is possible for me to enjoy political satire there have been several recent political films that didnt do a whole lot for me wag the dog for instance i found to be an intelligent but heartless film while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness bulworth is a far better film than these both in its execution and lasting impression its a tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it also has an emotional center writerdirectorstar warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character and in turn we like him and actually care about the story beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again he hasnt slept in days nor has he eaten and almost instantaneously he goes insane hes not stark raving mad not outright anyway but hes definitely bonkers its the final weekend of his campaign and his assistant murphy oliver platt has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto bulworth begins the speech but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest you mean one lady asks the democratic party doesnt care about the african american community well he shouts laughing isnt that obvious the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life he muses later that its a bad thing to make decisions when youre suicidal he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses graham beckel whom he believes to be the hitman bulworth also meets nina halle berry with whom he becomes infatuated suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworths no nonsense truth in politics methods become a national sensation and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that hes appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences beattys work on both sides of the camera is excellent his script and direction are both extremely sharp as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself here is a man whos reached his limit and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure i like that the film doesnt take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich although the anti rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film some of the segments are simply hilarious such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him much of the film is completely absurd but thats the fun part about it its an angry serious film at the core but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre what adds to this feeling is beattys portrayal of bulworth this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale beatty is so much fun to watch here hes always funny but hes also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcomings as a human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning the supporting cast is vast and colorful berry is luminous as always and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun toting toddlers to do his dirty work oliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting though hes very funny to watch paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections is bulworth offensive i suppose some may see it that way i wasnt offended by the film but then again i hardly care about politics i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story the film isnt perfect of course the ending didnt quite work for me and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film bulworth is a smart uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface, 1
dreamworks pictures presents a jinks cohen company production kevin spacey annette bening american beauty thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley and chris cooper co producers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l hall a s c produced by bruce cohen dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes both my wife and daughter think im this gigantic loser and theyre right i have lost something i didnt always feel this sedated with that piece of dialogue we are fully introduced to lester burnham kevin spacey a year old man trapped within his own life lester works for an advertising agency his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid life crisis he is suffering estranged from both his wife and his daughter lester starts to crack under the stress his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies and sullen apathy carolyn burnham annette bening is the prototypical career woman homemaker she carefully tends her rose garden decorates her home with the best furnishings but inside she is desperate unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family the third member of this anti family is jane burnham thora birch lester and carolyns daughter a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction this funny and frightening slice of life is refreshingly simple not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters most notably is barbara fitts allison janney the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts she has almost no dialogue and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one colonel fitts chris cooper is an angry and frightened man his rage directed almost singularly at his son ricky wes bentley who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnhams in fact they are the next door neighbors anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in american beauty alan ball who was the co executive producer of the hit tv series cybil and creator of the new sitcom oh grow up has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years not one character in this film rings falsely and the depth of personality in each is achingly honest and insightful the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as the graduate or lolita kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become lester tries to return to his youth he quits his job actually blackmailing his employer for one years salary starts smoking pot fantasizes about his daughters girlfriend angela mena suvari in a marvelous performance here starts working out and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet mr spaceys performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous that we can be certain that come oscar time we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy unable to cope with her growing disillusionment she forces herself to maintain her demeanor driving her further and further into desperation adultery and possibly murder ms bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning she is the prototypical trophy child when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team im so proud of you honey you didnt screw up once the bitterness and resentment are palpable thora birch is a young actress to watch praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance colonel finn is a man in complete denial his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma the boy next door who may be more foe than friend a deceitful and calculating young man whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him mr bentleys performance is the one troublesome note in the film that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar that one almost faults the performance for it director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle scenes of carolyn walking through the rain carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful capturing the season in all of its harsh beauty fall has never looked so inviting yet depressing every nuance of american beauty begs its audience to think and examine it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come and well it should as it is simply one of this years best, 1

a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates a film which was based on the best seller by george v higgins it is seen through the weary eyes of a year old small time hood eddie fingers coyle mitchum he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a year stretch in new hampshire something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesnt think he could survive prison at his age he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare he could have cut a deal and gotten off if he turned his boss over to the d a but he figured he would never live if he did that he is currently gun running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise rocco the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank managers house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it on one of the heists they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm coyles best friend is dillon boyle a hit man for the mob working as a bartender he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents as an aggressive young agent named foley jordan who likes to be called uncle gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs with the sentencing date closing in on him the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain thinking he made an iron clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down knowing full well the young hustler keats selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence but foley tells him after he arrests the gun dealer that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence they want him to be a full time informer warning spoiler follows in next paragraph the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says to be young like that and have his future hes the greatest hockey player in the world dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob style having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets of the hopeless situation the low level criminals are in and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next the city streets are ugly the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests whether it is betrayal or murder there is a fatalistic feel about their lives something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs as it overcomes a thin plot it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them mitchum is a loser and that he lived so long is a tribute to his skills as a survivor but in the end he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle, 1
films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success whether theyre about superheroes batman superman spawn or geared toward kids casper or the arthouse crowd ghost world but theres never really been a comic book like from hell before for starters it was created by alan moore and eddie campbell who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid s with a part series called the watchmen to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd the book or graphic novel if you will is over pages long and includes nearly more that consist of nothing but footnotes in other words dont dismiss this film because of its source if you can get past the whole comic book thing you might find another stumbling block in from hells directors albert and allen hughes getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in well anything but riddle me this who better to direct a film thats set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society the ghetto in question is of course whitechapel in londons east end its a filthy sooty place where the whores called unfortunates are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision when the first stiff turns up copper peter godley robbie coltrane the world is not enough calls in inspector frederick abberline johnny depp blow to crack the case abberline a widower has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium upon arriving in whitechapel he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly heather graham say it isnt so and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon cant stomach i dont think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper so i wont go into the particulars here other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay in the comic they dont bother cloaking the identity of the ripper but screenwriters terry hayes vertical limit and rafael yglesias les mis rables do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end its funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because after all an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts and from hells ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days who holds back the electric carwho made steve guttenberg a star dont worry itll all make sense when you see it now onto from hells appearance its certainly dark and bleak enough and its surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did at times it seems like sleepy hollow the print i saw wasnt completely finished both color and music had not been finalized so no comments about marilyn manson but cinematographer peter deming dont say a word ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic oscar winner martin childs shakespeare in love production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place even the acting in from hell is solid with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent ians holm joe goulds secret and richardson dalmatians log in great supporting roles but the big surprise here is graham i cringed the first time she opened her mouth imagining her attempt at an irish accent but it actually wasnt half bad the film however is all good r for strong violencegore sexuality language and drug content, 1
for those of us who werent yet born when the s rock n rolled around monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies from otis redding to jimi hendrix janis joplin to the mamas and the papas and jefferson airplane to the who this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves shot in at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time sure some have painted their faces and smoke joints but d a pennebaker the war room moon over broadway surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience no matter who is watching it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul the excitement starts before the music even begins a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer she replies that she feels lucky to do so there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers tries to get in touch with dionne warwick and when one band is tuning up a member remarks finally a decent sound system you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isnt about vanity its about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it a two way street this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience its impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain and while the lyrics to wild thing may not be all that complicated watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love even if you dont recognize every band you see on stage you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats the only drawback to the film is the ending which unfortunately i must reveal all the other bands big names then and still today got approximately to minutes of screen time in contrast the last band on camera a wholly forgettable one gets an entire minutes of screen time for a film thats only minutes long thats too large of a chunk especially when previous acts are much more stimulating all in all monterey pop is a precious rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us the variety of music as well as the beautifully shot performances are easy to become immersed in if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular this is quickly dispelled its almost depressing to think that music this moving doesnt get made much anymore instead were stuck with nsync the backstreet boys and jennifer lopez all of whom should have stuck with modeling, 1
at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of year olds thats true of home alone and id bet money that its true of home alone opening soon but home alone actually has a lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesnt get in the way the mcalisters all of them are going to france for the holidays four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kids cruelty kevins patience runs out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza has already been eaten and hes going to have to starve he attacks his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table a few cousins and an uncle the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased but they all point their fingers when he fights back the ultimate punishment comes from mom catherine ohara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night on his way up the stairs he tells her that families suck and that he hopes never to see any of his family again that night the power goes out knocking out the alarm clocks so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport in a surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family heads off without him its interesting that in a subtle way his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class theyre two thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child meanwhile kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true hes finally rid of his family life is a dream come true he can jump on the beds watch r rated movies eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips and dig through his big brothers secret box slowly the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane he grooms himself he does the laundry he goes shopping i bought some milk eggs and fabric softener he also starts to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring the furnace in the basement is a scary monster the old man next door is a snow shovel murderer and two crooks are trying to break into his house macaulay culkin is cute but he isnt much of an actor still we can see that kevins character grows thanks to some good direction and editing for example acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night just as santa is getting in his car kevin asks the man to pass on his request he wants his family back to the real santa he learned how to deal with the furnace you turn on the lights and its not so scary anymore he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow shovel murderer who actually turns out to be a nice man they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid finally in the last minutes kevin confronts his last fear the bandits head on literally this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movies genuine dramatic setup it is dessert its a lot of fun and it doesnt overwhelm the rest of the movie on the whole home alone is a great holiday movie john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings but it does have its flaws the smallest problem is that culkin doesnt act very well as i said before he is cute but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkins insight into his character the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villains threaten kevins life about five times instead of im gonna get that kid they say im gonna kill that kid some might argue that the tone is the same but i strongly disagree mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux pas ill probably never see home alone and i wish i had skipped home alone but i do enjoy home alone almost every year dont let your impressions of the others detract from the original which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick, 1
