if youre into watching near on two hours of bored foul mouthed florida teens having sex doing drugs having sex listening to eminem having sex playing video games having sex and killing one of their peers then bully s for you based on jim schutzes novelization of a true life event bully charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who in murdered their high school bully in cold calculated blood the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers in the hands of controversial director larry clark kids however it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmakers pornographic proclivities in terms of the incident and what provoked it bully stirs up nothing new the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot bored with life not much ambition promiscuous profane the bully in question bobby kent nick stahl is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesnt exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department he hounds and harries and humiliates his best friend marty played by brad renfro and martys girlfriend lisa rachel miner doesnt care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby simply remove him from the equation marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous profane and stoner friends plus a recruited hit man lure bobby to a swamp one night stab him beat him over the head with a baseball bat and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators presumably finish him off theres no remorse the next day theyre talking about it as openly as a homework assignment they did it because they wanted to and because they could whats most troubling about the film however isnt the unsettling subject matter and the matter of fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in bully but theres also an uneasy exploitative feel to it gratuitous crotch shots abound one of which makes the zipper cut away in theres something about mary look like the height of subtlety clark is so pre occupied with his female predominantly leads that you forget at times what this movie is supposed to be about the stripping bare literally and figuratively of these actors who are after all playing underage teenagers becomes harder to watch over time as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera the conclusion of bully offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime its a short sequence of stills heather years ali years lisa life imprisonment for example but its infinitely more telling than the minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it bully aims for truth exploits it shamelessly then bludgeons it to death, 0
among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early s woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty star of the b grade action films of the previous decade those who tend not to be nostalgic about s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star as director ginty did very little to improve that impression the protagonist of the movie is jack played by jeff fahey yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford played by bo derek however she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer one stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder however his good friend walter j hill robert mitchum happens to be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots unfortunately this film isnt comedy and any laugh is unintentional the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them the actors that play them dont help either that is especially the case with jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison his partner bo derek on the other hand shows that she didnt age enough to cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents ginty on the other hand tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer, 0
various films seen at the seattle film festival its all truethree men on a raft u s a director orson welles a recently uncovered one fourth of orson welles planned docu drama of amazing stories around the world named its all true this short dealt with welles attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welles attempts to film it despite studio problems a staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians sadie thompson u s a director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on w somerset maughams story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capras lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills i was interested to see sadie thompson where the last minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen little awkwardness and a very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadies soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on i cannot believe maughams short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion weve been waiting an hour and a half for still its entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymores incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds a c movie worth if you can find it the pied piper czechoslovakia director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate and with a lot of political comment along with it perhaps economic content is a better word it certainly doesnt show capitalism in a good light nor human nature nor anything else for that matter as you may have guessed this is not a tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over not that it wasnt interesting for technical reasons this is stop animation that is very well done all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts except for the animated stuffed rats boy sounds like a real comedy vehicle doesnt it add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night some gore dont bring children to this one dont bring adults to this one unless theyre fascinated by puppetry andor hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped blech no fun whatsoever meier west germany directorscreenwriter peter timm cast rainier grenkowitz nadja engelbrecht alexander hauff thomas besvater sub titled this film takes us back and forth over the east germanwest german border with meier an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money his uncle also in the west sneaks meier out of the country unknown to the east germans meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in east germany after a round the world trip his boss thinks hes on leave in bulgaria meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crews work while everyone thinks hes still living in east germany of course something goes wrong and the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there the humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting still a good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny c the right hand man australia director di drew screenplay helen hodgman cast rupert everett hugo weaving arthur dignam jennifer claire catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie going and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival ive learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to be wary of french comedies these people like jerry lewis ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old pouty lips is probably not worth watching when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult not impossible witness malcolm last year task well i ignored rules last night and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards its as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the s about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses lots and lots of horses the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir unfortunately said son a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident highlights include the amputation sequence the doctors daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for a diagnosis their tender kissing with a window between them while its raining youd think a woman studying medicine would know better the photography is good but i kept wishing for bw everything seems sepia colored anyway actually i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead but thats life grade z avoid like the plague unless youre looking for inadvertent yuks, 0
out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey a cold uninvolving confusing new thriller though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard author of out of sight as well as jackie brown get shorty and pulp fiction after you watch it you realize that its not nearly good enough in an aggressively non linear fashion the limey li mey noun an english gentleman tells the story of wilson terrence stamp a british ex con just released from a year stint in prison for armed robbery he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny he doesnt know much about the circumstances of her demise all he has is a name terry valentine valentine was jennys former boyfriend a wealthy and corrupt record executive hes played by peter fonda in his first major role since the terrific ulees gold in seeking valentines reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party he winds up breaking his cover eventually setting off valentines head of security and valentine himself who decides to run for it what a mess i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time pulp fiction which twisted time every which way was a masterpiece but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer the limey does exactly that the plot is permeated with flashbacks flash forwards and what can only be described as random time travel without any evident purpose there is no method to this movies madness it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably the plot isnt particularly interesting in the first place traditional mildly hackneyed and not very involving this is a sort of brooding film our protagonist doesnt speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude i felt like the director wasnt very interested in the proceedings himself almost like he made this film for a paycheck ditto for the editing which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal hes not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor hes shy quiet but always effective hes adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression his feelings dont always show on his face by you can always tell what they are this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion why soderbergh couldnt just parrot down and tell a story i dont know but what he does do certainly doesnt work the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil even the action scenes dont work may have signified the death of the traditional act one act two act three storyline but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it shall we go back to basics, 0
hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films in a nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership a lot of hong kongs best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u s productions such talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yun fat anna the king the corrupter and yuen woo ping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai unfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kongs rhythms the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing russell wong kai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kais boss and leader of the local chinese family a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down its not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends the following morning po sing is found dead suspicions escalate as issac oday delroy lindo is told of the murder his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture issac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter the scene shifts to a prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined hung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work escaping to the u s han sets out to find the person responsible for his brothers death romeo must die is in many ways a fun film it is both absurd and assured the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes the godfather the relationship between jet lis han and aaliyahs trish oday reminds us of abel ferreras china girl except that romeo must dies couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable li of course has the showiest part having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination allayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace its obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic but still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it delro lindo as issac oday carries himself well in the film an unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d b woodside as issacs son colin the performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film having a career as one of the industrys best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots and romeo must die does look good but the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayahs bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever the best things about the film are its fight scenes jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles one needs only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat here jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that lethal weapon jets u s debut didnt allow unfortunately a lot of jets fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision also romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an x ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent obviously a homage to the famed x ray scene from sonny chibas streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film its as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted one problem though about the fight scenes those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon they do have an internal rhythm to them a heartbeat so to speak in their choreography the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance this is created by the performance the direction and the editing here in romeo must die there is no staccato every fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern the rhythm is monotonous a hong kong film has a tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact rmd is limited to a standard tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chans films watch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help now look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx there you have a heartbeat and emotional draw that doesnt let the audience catch its breath the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted here in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl jet li is a grand and personable screen presence its a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here one day filmmakers here in the u s will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity until then well be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die, 0
supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in john patterson val kilmer the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation tried to rid his operation of the lions but fails a world renound hunter remington michael douglas is called in and the battle man against lion begins this film has a great soundtrack and wonderful scenery the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin we only see one side of each character kilmer is a bridge builder and thats all we see him as these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesnt even appear to be too upset about it and the plot its jaws but with lions again were presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should it appears to kill men because it just likes too why who knows i guess there wouldnt be much of a story if it didnt the problem is that there isnt much of a story even though it does, 0
so ask yourself what mm eight millimeter is really all about is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of big town americana theres a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wont necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires or is it about those who can those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see im not talking about snuff films supposed documentaries of victims being brutalized and killed on camera im talking about films like mm and its director joel schumacher with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit batman robin a time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly has that kind of influence is mm something you really want to see probably not the first two thirds of mm unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama albeit with a particularly unsavory core then as its been threatening all along the film explodes into violence and just when you think its finally over schumacher tags on a ridiculous self righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further trust me there are better ways to waste two hours of your life nicolas snake eyes cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husbands safe documents a young girls murder welles goes about his assignment rather matter of factly and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost as if you dont need any specialized skills or training to do this welles certainly makes it look easy and cops obviously never look in toilet tanks for clues the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george c scott in paul schraders hardcore occasionally a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split level home in harrisburg pa mm doesnt condemn or condone its subject matter it just exploits it the irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walkers vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r rated first run hollywood product so we only see snippets of snuff and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror later its the turn of joaquin phoenix whos quite good and by far the films most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again all this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviants are not indeed monsters but everyday people like you and me neither super nor standard mm is shocking only in its banality, 0

from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which im guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it hasnt worked since the million dollar movie has yet to break million to each its own however since monkey bone is not only a bad movie all together but technically well made a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone a crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder when stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in a freak car accident youll see stu goes into a coma and while in his coma stu travels to im guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life people are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them when stu spots monkey bone whom he really cant stand he tries to keep him under control making a new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life when monkey bone and stu steal a pass monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stus body now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or something like that rather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development for instance we really dont get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her but we are not given a chance to know her the cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast dave foley isnt given enough to do as well as will graces megan mullally who can be funny the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust the special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes some of them are believable and some unbelievable for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really dont realize that he is animated but on occasion it sneaks up on you the direction by henry selick is good but at times he doesnt know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff its too bad really monkey bone could have been a real good movie but with its heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role for those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one, 0

some movies i should just skip my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back and here comes another disney effects filled live action flick based on an old tv program true the probgram is only years old this time and its a cartoon but its a cartoon i liked and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen but my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be turns out i was right mostly inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jive talking side kick at first i thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isnt just business its a way of life the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits in some parts you can just hear them saying more zany i want more zany here and here lets have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful i want the audience squirming in their seats ok thats fine but i want you to add bug guts what does this scene do character depth but wheres the zaniness i dont see zany here if you cant make it zany cut it the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie michelle who plays penny gadgets niece shines in every scene shes in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor dabney colemans comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor oteris overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregons own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasnt poking fun at our fair town or maybe all career politicians are like that i must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla he appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film d l hughley plays the shuckin and jivin vehicular side kick in a role that firmly sets emancipation back years the dialog is lets face it its pretty bad the tag line after a major set piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context a lot of the lines especially hughleys appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for ad lib about three quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon let me rage here just for a minute michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character shes utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pint size detective why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity inspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but its a very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits the evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds its onscreen all in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films i wonder if disney uses the revenues for its generally money making cartoons to produce these losers but if true why if theyre trying for another mary poppins they need to find a team that can produce one and then give them a chance to do it, 0

forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects set in at salem massachusetts the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor daniel day lewis abigail winona ryder suddenly seizes a chicken beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood taking even adolescent hormone surges into account surely this chicken bashing bit is a bit excessive especially for prim puritan sensibilities surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur millers name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play this is far from a harmless event a bad start to an already shaky morality tale the play describes the films opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply and this adds to the plays charged atmosphere in the film the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandoras box not only is credulity stretched but abigails obsession is unfortunately spotlighted it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot not surprisingly the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning witches are invoked by those eager to blame when the girls are questioned their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses led lustfully by abigail with alarming synchronicity our hormonally advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents constant reminders that abigails passion sets all this into inexorable motion abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctors love his wife elizabeth joan allen by including her among those accused of witchcraft appropriately narrow waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over earnestness that longs to be watched director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foaming mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration otherwise hytners direction is unremarkable ryders performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing allens elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed unfortunately when johns audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message the result is a clumsy muddle i felt like the chicken from the opening scene head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy handed to be wholly believable when the gallows beckoned it was sweet release indeed far from bewitching the crucible tests the patience, 0
im really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone sure she is one of the most beautiful creatures on gods green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in she always strikes out the crush was a slow moving predictable piece of fluff hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in clueless was an annoying unfunny waste of time and people have e mailed me too saying clueless is a good movie and that im the only one who doesnt like it one girl said if id seen the movie with an open mind i would have enjoyed it nothing could be further from the truth i went into the theater expecting to love the movie the preview looked good and of course im crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny unlikable characters almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way when we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasnt me yelled out that was the worst fin movie ive ever seen and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicias pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ill probably never understand made me rent it anyway what i got was minutes of regret the worst alicia silverstone movie ever and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like where to begin in criticizing this movie the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it was by a ten year old alicia is the star and shes still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever there is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minutes when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero so why does this movie get one star out of me well alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub and if it wasnt bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four star features but you settle for what you can get alicia plays a babysitter whos spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home at least that movie critic at large guy does as the movie trods along we discover shes not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male characters fantasies and probably every male viewers too the drunken father thinks shes just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while shes taking her bubble bath they even throw in the middle aged wifes fantasies about a male counterpart at the party not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this pound woman in a black silk teddy at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated in fact i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that theres absolutely no nudity in it so you cant call it a sex flick ive already pointed out that it cant fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter as bad, 0
there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film two is never greenlight a sci fi film starring john travolta to wit we present the disaster that is battlefield earth a science fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior sci fi is always a tricky beast tight script a good director an ensemble cast of decent actors and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes heres the plot the year is mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the demons who dwell in the cities below the psychlos are strip mining the earth for its resources and terel played by travolta is the head of security for the miningslave base located in denver a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler played with dramatic flair by barry pepper ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the demons he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base after several attempts at escape johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terels involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end jonnie assumed leader of the mining slave group then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry the bill of rights how to use a machine gun and how to fly a harrier jet the whole mess concludes with a big loud obnoxious gun and plane battle that had me praying for the end credits roger christian the director of this lumbering beast must have rented dune blade runner planet of the apes independence day stargate beastmaster the airwolf episodes the v miniseries the matrix and the omega man and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe really the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit travoltas acting hasnt been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like you can have your freedom if you fight then theres the script the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and take back the planet would be a difficult task to achieve why because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt for no particular reason beside the fact that humans are stupid terel may be right you know humans made this movie, 0

this feature is like a double header two sets of clich s for the price of one not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts but the banal rich girl poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins based on a story by falls merely lobs its plotline at the audience this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching summer catch centers around ryan dunne freddie prinze jr a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country ryan is a blue collar kind of guy he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cods rich and famous he also as we are informed early his own worst enemy he has the potential and the talent but always seems to self destruct at the crucial moment so ryan tries to remained focused on baseball then he meets tenley parrish jessica biel daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures tenley a name only a hack screenwriter could invent is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan if you cant figure out where all this nonsense leads then you need a remedial course in film viewing as always prinze is pretty to look at but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions puppy dog love heartbreak frustration self loathing or determination biel cries a lot while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class conscious father the only beacon is matthew lillards fun loving billy brubaker the teams catcher summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies such as bull durham and the natural no curve balls here no sliders every pitch is predictable a blind umpire could call this movie summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn, 0
play it to the bone the newest addition to ron sheltons sports themed repertoire fails in numerous ways like most of sheltons other great films bull durham white men cant jump this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots sheltons films are not considered sports films but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse the film has no social message like its predecessors the relationship between the friends two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for thousand dollars is very confusing for a number of reasons the whole film since it is primarily a buddy picture depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other unfortunately it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below we never see how cesar antonio banderas and vince woody harrelson meet the two are so different from each other that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something the third character on the trip grace lolita davidovich stands in the way she is in nearly every scene with them making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other there are two many interfering irrelevant side stories vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner these boring tales only hurt the central plot when it comes to time for the two men to fight they dont even hesitate to pound each other wasnt the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with the film wants to be over shelton on the other hand continues to tell his story forty five painful minutes remain the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies however the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile kind of like the whole film, 0
there will be another the ads for this sequel proclaimed and why not true brandon lee is dead but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to s the crow anyway the idea of spinning artist james obarrs original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie taking its own righteous vengeance against the world given that basic framework the story could move in any number of directions of course it doesnt stubbornly the crow city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film when lees eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality in flashback we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover and then we watch in real time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind its loud and repetitive true a sadists delight but its also horrifying and fascinating city of angels gives us more of the same but less skillfully theres an audience guaranteed for a film like this although bad reviews and poor word of mouth will likely ensure that it wont be much of a success in fact miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings ive never understood the reasoning behind this tactic since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup this time ashe french accented actor vincent perez is retrieved from his watery death he and his young son were shackled together shot and then thrown off a pier by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead perez might have some screen presence if hes given something to do with himself but here hes simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face at first hes shivery and frightened but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave hes befriended by sarah mia kirshner presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film kirshner so beguiling in exotica is here an exquisitely photographed blank tattooed with angels wings sarah is just about as lovely as women come but she serves no purpose not even as seductress the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah richard brooks but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop who plays a gaunt fellow named curve iggy all bones veins and drawl is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film like all good things here hes dispatched too soon and without much imagination in the meantime were subjected to tedious glimpses of judahs compound where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in sm fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they werent distinctly secondhand even the soundtrack is tired more than anything ive seen from hollywood lately city of angels smacks baldly of product its a movie with a lousy script but a great look critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope but his work isnt that bad per se hes got a good eye and some intriguing visual ideas if anything this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery his major stylistic failing is that he cant seem to direct an action scene and the quick nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie but as director he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasnt the performers who couldnt and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved who bought david s goyers anemic script anyway the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference, 0
note to screenwriters and self when you hit the big time and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer tell em all to hit the road gilligan wrote the arbitrarily titled home fries ten years ago it was shelved until he found success as one of the took a second look at gilligans comedy they read it again wearing rose tinted glasses drew stars as sally a dim but sweet pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states the father of her child is dead the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons these flyboys scared him with their low flying helicopter dorian wilson and angus busey were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ohara trouble is sally picked up some interference on her drive thru headset and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing so dorian goes undercover as a burger flipper before you can say with cheese he falls for the mother to be too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally does this sound like a movie you want to see without a doubt the best thing about home fries is barrymore at the risk of sounding sexist shes never looked better than here as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple cheek cute and gawk at wilson her real life boyfriend but the plot and the situations are so off putting that nothing could save it this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers but home fries brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel its raising arizona without babies without charm without laughs without human characters and without intelligence worst of all its creepy whats funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun unless the woman in question is a spice girl take out the helicopters the quasi incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons it is absolutely illogical within the movies framework that dorian still lives with his mother and brother and the scenes of murder attempted and otherwise and what are you left with the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint but dreams of becoming a country singer that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made but itd be better than home fries, 0
snake eyes is the most aggravating kind of movie the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing its not just because this is a brian depalma film and since hes a great director and one whos films are always greeted with at least some fanfare and its not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance this film is hardly worth his talents its worse than that its aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half assedness or more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighth assedness in certain circles snake eyes was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawas classic rashomon where a crime is told from the four different and i mean different perspectives and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening which i might add is superb in one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife interupts a pay per view event on tv chases down a gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talks with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise whos character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn whos also in this and watches as it happens theres a big name in the crowd and thats the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani whos sitting behind rick and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out this all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this film asks and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene and discovers theres a very good possibility it was a conspiracy as we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in a panic and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casinohotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened this is all going pretty fine and dandy and its extremely interesting to watch then it takes one wrong step we follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out but thats not the worst part of it its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it it only gets worse the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we cant rely on ricks investigation to be all that interesting its as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible events become more and more proposterous and by the end the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this the deux ex machina thats where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay this time its a hurricane an out of control police car and a big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this depalma who idolizes hitchcock to death has done many a film like this such as his masterpiece blow out where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece but granted depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch what with his over the top shot set ups notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries at least his direction makes up partly for it then theres koepp who showed such great ability at making a characters flaws come to life like he did in depalmas earlier carlitos way a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well he can write a flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just a half assed effort hes flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasnt so formulaic a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup he may as well have said the opposite of what he says it would have at least gone with what the character was like this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way as i was watching the first half hour i couldnt wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspectives hed be given and perhaps hed have to make a choice between whos he has to believe now theres a film unfortunately the film has two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap weve seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma, 0
reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger scream and arlington rd are the others each derivative in their own special way the guy cant seem to write believable dialogue sample from reindeer games rule never put a car thief behind the wheel create multi faceted characters or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie was gonna go here f ck you jack ass take that twist decipher this mother f cker its almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is auteur theory be damned its krugers style not the directors that winds up on screen kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut sometimes less is more and his numerous twists cant even claim to be originals arlington rds ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer games we get this ol gem character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldnt know pronouns used to protect the gender of the character grammar be damned how did you know that the stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along since twist endings are currently so in vogue and seeing as how krugers screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending i guess its no wonder why he works so frequently hes quickly becoming miramaxs mickey mouse the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects this is appropriate considering that miramax which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicles their companys current logo could be we ride the trends reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick affleck is such a puppy dog that its impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyones bitch the role itself is so badly written the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it the twists so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent serious movie getting it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy whos played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance james frain is nick rudys cellmate a manslaughterer whos found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though shes never seen one picture of him which works out fine since the character is killed in a near riot and rudy who was to be paroled on the same day as nick takes his place which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda looks like rape and a surprise visit from ashleys brother gabriel gary sinise who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co horts he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley used to work as a guard in the indian casino though by the end the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything ive described might as well be irrelevant this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on several scenes in which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one liner included two scenes of two different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no less though its an action film the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on incredulous as the audience the flick was directed by john frankenheimer a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the a list following a string of flops and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin one of those almost but not quite movies which followed the island of dr morneau you remember the one with marlon brando in mime make up and a not so flattering moo moo and now this he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain zapped mtv audience to pick apart problem is these action scenes nearly all failed escapes serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play character problems abound rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of which is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster charlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her to play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this gary sinise has played this role frequently and here as in snake eyes he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he goes again than a threat these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience, 0
for better or worse the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated oversexed underwritten thrillers apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesnt change a thing since body of evidence wasnt written by him but has a puzzling eszterhas ish presence all over it in other words its a really dirty and b really really stupid madonna first warning sign stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi naked presumably for the edification of the shrimp shes been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless shes under thirty or at least looks it and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men whats worse is that the movie confirms all the above and wallows in them as well madonnas character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition and yes there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy this movie leave no scummy stone unturned anyway willem dafoe very good but completely wasted also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonnas sexuality how do we know this because his character is set up with the token wife and kids how obvious is it that hes gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up and get kicked out of the house and get welcomed back anyway dont skip to the end yet were just getting warmed up dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie most of it is about as erotic as open heart surgery since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax always the kink of choice among screenwriters who dont know the first thing about really kinky sex and smashed light bulbs dont ask another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story its insanely dull whats worse is that body of evidence is dull everywhere not just in the sex scenes the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes the thriller business itself is ridiculous it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor and the ending another homage to eszterhas maybe is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact frame where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in the director is uli edel all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f everyone has to eat i guess but this isnt a meal ticket its leftovers, 0
plot a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth oops i mean an evil man he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself anyway fourteen years go by and arrgh well you know the rest swish swish zzzzzzz critique this is a pretty bad movie lets see where should i start okay first of all the story is just plain boring its not original is entirely predictable and lacks energy okay whats next acting you say hmmmm well the main actor justin chambers is basically an uncharismatic version of chris odonnell but with less range think about that and mena suvari is just plain off not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons dragons but entirely miscast with bad deliveries awful sequences and a piss poor accent that comes and goes now im not sure if this was ms suvaris fault or the directors but ive definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film the only semi saving grace actor wise is tim roth as the irrepressible bad guy but once again its not something that we havent seen before a thousand times by the same guy tim please for the love of god beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day american roles for you as a nice guy in a romantic comedy or something stretch dude stretch we all know that you can do much better than this gunk alright what else was bad in this film oh yeah the score yikes hows about taking it down a few notches there fellas this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene but actually does little more than annoy i think its important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isnt a real epic by any stretch of the imagination its a fluffy rehashed cake walk created by some shrewd studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole kung fu phenomenon in films and test it out on an old classic dudes you failed all around keep reading the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems plentiful why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top why dont they just cut the mouseketeers rope at the top of the tower instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging why doesnt anybody look a day older when the sequence says years later at least change your shirt man keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a fun time but this flick just didnt cut it for me it was boring for stretches the acting was atrocious at times the romantic scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat i will give the movie this much and that is that its main reason for being its raison detre as the french would say its fight sequences do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer but what you see there are essentially the snippets from the two major and cool swashbuckling sequences from the film the first comes right at the beginning of the movie while the other essentially finishes the film off hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this films credits hullo the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers deneuve is barely in this movie ugh just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash now say it together gang all for one and one for all we vow to stay away from it all thank me later wheres joblo coming from a knights tale american outlaws crouching tiger hidden dragon the matrix the replacement killers romeo must die shanghai noon, 0
the world on land its just too big for me starring tim roth pruitt taylor vince bill nunn clarence williams iii rated r the legend of s is the years most absurd movie a rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful as ever as a guy named you heard right his name is in all actuality he was born on an ocean liner on uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny a ship crewman spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of dannys fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matters well when is about or so he starts wondering all around the ship one day he discovers a grand piano he sits down and starts playing miraculously what comes out is beautiful a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age when one of the people who knows tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulations replies f ck the regulations ho ho ho grows up never setting foot on dry land when hes about ish and can play the piano like nobodys business onboard comes another musician his name is max pruitt taylor vince and he plays the trumpet after catches max barfing everywhere during a storm he sits him down on the piano next to him takes the pianos braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall taking them with it how the chair theyre sitting on and the piano dont separate i dont know but this apparently isnt the kind of thing were supposed to ask after that and max become friends max is determined to get off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but has no intention of doing so whats more he doesnt even want his music to go anywhere without him when a record company hears about his talents they come on board to make a record of his music but after finding out that gasp theyre going to make millions of copies he breaks the record the conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get off the ship gets off himself he stumbles upon a record of s music in a store the record shouldnt exist because a never stepped on dry land and b the one record that was made on the ship was broken ladies and gentlemen its a mystery the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements were supposed to be roused by a climactic piano duel there isnt anything in this movie with the potential to compel comes off as a whiny brooding extremely unlikable man i cant recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life ditto for max who doesnt seem to have a life outside his friendship with tim roth plays with about as much panache as a fig leaf theres no spirit no gusto to the character he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship but to us he is dead pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenges to the aforementioned piano duel the legend of was made by giuseppe tornatore whose cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many this effort is utterly limp and lifeless at once ridiculous boring narrow sighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten, 0
susan grangers review of the watcher universal just what we need another lurid trashy serial killer saga this time keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking clock cat and mouse game with james spader a burnt out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd to taunt spader who has relocated to chicago reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too before long he starts mailing photographs of the lonely unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims challenging spader along with the chicago police department to stop him within hours before he strikes again in the midst of this murderous frenzy theres spaders psychologist played by marisa tomei who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in the cell writers david elliot clay ayers and darcy meyers along with first time director joe charbanic helmer of music videos for reeves band dogstar dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase revealing early on exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop need each other to give meaning to our lives plus as reeves explains were all stacked right on top of each other but we dont notice each other any more after that its all sound effects and tricky camera work along with a muddled discordant soundtrack james spaders acting technique can be described as wooden deadpan while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone dude persona which sometimes works sometimes doesnt chris ellis as spaders self important colleague is the only cast member who manages to be convincing on the granger movie gauge of to the watcher is an appallingly awful amateurish the real torture is watching it, 0
mr nice guy is the latest jackie chan film so you should know what to expect a weak plot terrible dialogue very little acting ability but some jaw dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile however mr nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever jackie chan plays who else jackie this time out hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show not that it ever makes a difference in the plot there are only two scenes of him cooking for the rest of the film somehow he mutates into jackie chan supercop it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege a tv newswoman diana gabrielle fitzpatrick covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo richard norton and a local gang of toughs the demons although she only has one camcorder somehow the result is full of close ups and multiple angles hmmm shades of broadcast news anyway the goons discover diana and will do anything to recover the tape here lies another crucial flaw in the story doesnt anyone realize you can copy a tape oh well no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense as luck would have it diana runs across jackie and wouldnt you know it jackie accidentally ends up with the tape this leads to countless chase andor fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie in a move apparently designed to woo american and other english speaking audiences the film uses english as its primary language however that doesnt mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases strangely many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english and poorly too whether this is just a very bad case of looping an effort to minimize accents or a simple case of nostalgia it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films the plot in mr nice guy is negligible merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackies films it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread look if you have jackie chan playing a chef why not use that to your advantage watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts the action is a mixed bag here theres really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan the action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes the films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting once or twice it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence but to slo mo jackie running either this is a nod to the six million dollar man or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down if youve seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix go ahead and see mr nice guy however if youre just in the mood for some good action youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work such as supercop, 0
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla his entrance however is a grand one out from the trees he leaps gargantuan and imposing sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have joe bellows at the poachers before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars during this scene i turned to my friend and said wow thats some ape joe is quite a gorilla a big digital gorilla he runs around the fields chasing cars and people he picks things up and stares at them pensively he breaks things on accident because hes just too big to avoid clumsiness joe as a special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes as a character he doesnt quite register and the story hes been put in is as limp as they come the words family entertainment have never been a stamp of quality but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart the picture is a remake of the film its mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly as a formality the movie also has a few human characters the main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent a lover of gorillas as a child she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother now she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife specifically shes out to protect joe a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood soon zoologist gregg ohara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jills mother so in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers in addition the space is way too small for him after all he is a really big gorilla and to add to the complications strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jills mother jill of course doesnt recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film the movie isnt really offensive it has some competent actors a few nifty sets and a lot of scenes with a big digitized gorilla but the story is really dumb there arent any characters and the film isnt satisfying on any level beyond its visuals the movie also has bad dialogue if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue its only fair to quote some of it but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like joe isnt happy and joe isnt safe here we need to get joe out of here joe is way too big for that cage i dont know if these phrases are word for word but theyre close as i said the characters here are only present as a formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them sadly mighty joe young wastes them both there are a few clever moments although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and as i said the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes its certainly not a bad film for kids i doubt joe will give them nightmares but adults in the audience arent likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while after that something needs to be done with the big gorilla nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla, 0
funny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways the ghost and the darkness promised at least it seemed to me to promise a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature what it delivered was mystery science theater level material an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters get new jobs was one line if i remember correctly at the end of the th century col patterson val kilmer whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda he is having immensely stereotypical problems the natives are restless his boss is a jerk and now two man eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off patterson tries to handle the situation himself incompetently and then turns to charles remington michael douglas a hunter of world reknown or something like that the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions they should have gotten top billing and co starred with siegfried and roy they are nigh invulnerable as one comic book put it and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature give me a break the movie hasnt got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas its just trying to find convenient ways to stall us even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic get this remingtons big plan is to build a large scaffold like structure in the middle of the savannah sit on it and wait for the lion to show up he does this and then gets knocked off by a bird by the end of the movie the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand the acting is forgettable douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow but its nothing he hasnt done before kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else somewhere else and the rest vanish into the cinematography the camera by the way sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent what did i expect from this movie i dunno some real excitement i suppose a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation no such luck i dug out my tattered copy of hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind, 0

capsule in on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct that the new film comes off as his homage to himself to john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes for a writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is a very bad mistake to make ghosts of mars is called a horror movie but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low powered alien menace in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds to sue this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct the thing and prince of darkness it is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience ghosts of mars takes place in the year mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the films budget it is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth normal again making it easier to film society has changed a bit by that time but it has advanced surprisingly little apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control and from carpenters view women have really made a mess of things society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in years than we might expect it to change in ten the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct except that precinct yes precinct has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony instead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film has the criminal desolation williams instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination the story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red yellow and black carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars red planet and ghosts of mars after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by i rate ghosts of mars a on the to scale and a on the to scale following the movie i showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did carpenters classic assault on precinct her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice, 0
virus is the type of cliched vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it strangely enough on the same mid january weekend last year another film was released like this deep rising about an ugly monster on a cruise liner prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include s leviathan s deep star six and all four alien pictures virus in comparison is a servicable thriller well made and produced but since it doesnt include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on based on a series of comic books virus concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking un lucky for them a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen once the team reaches the russian ship they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted after turning the power back on however there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself one survivor finally does turn up nadia joanna pacula who informs the suicidal and stern captain donald sutherland and one of the crew kit foster jamie lee curtis that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out if virus sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies youre correct although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life the film itself doesnt appear to have a brain in its head the film sticks so close to the worn out conventions of the creature genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play in her second return to horror in the last year jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine but that is about it although s halloween h was also a disappointment at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character unlike here donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films such as s the puppet masters although i just watched him in the superb sci fi classic invasion of the body snatchers where he was fabulous the last of the three top billers is william baldwin but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture since he has nothing to do basically virus is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space shipocean linerhaunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one by one it is not the worst of its type but it is far from one of the best and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this as long as some of them keep making money i suspect the answer is never, 0

theres a foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact id say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release the early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking the repeating cycle is as follows the president morgan freeman will go on tv and tell the country that theres a remote chance a comet will strike the earth but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem then we get to see the plan in action in some sequence utterly lacking suspense the mission will barely fail and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth and theres a remote chance it will strike but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem it goes on and on throughout the movie but every time freeman goes on tv we know his plan is going to fail how do we know this because weve seen the tv ads for deep impact ads that feature freeman telling the nation that the comet is still headed right for us and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading ladies and gentlemen that is the movie successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its second tv spots television is whats wrong with deep impact the main character played by tea leoni is a low level broadcast journalist for msnbc and thats the mere tip of the product placement iceberg who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy she thinks its an instance of an ex secretary of something or other james cromwell resigning because of a mistress and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area when she goes nosing around cromwell he begs her to keep it under wraps i know youre just a reporter but you used to be a human being she figures out whats really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction level comet upon a top secret meeting with president freeman leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference at which she gets to ask the first question and everyone knows if you get to ask the first question baby youre a star leoni ends up in the anchor chair broadcasting every step of the comets collision course with earth and im sure its comforting for her to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of months shes a cable news personality so there she is narrating the six astronaut mission to blow the comet up such personalities as robert duvall jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged out process but as anyone whos seen the commercials knows the astronauts fail they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces which means even more destruction to the earth yeah thanks nasa thats when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who arent picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years they even have animals two by two ready to climb into the cave if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife while people pack the highways out of town the reasoning is of course that if a comet is going to strike they might as well be out in some scenic rural location and amusingly the highway is spotted with people in u haul trucks im sure its comforting to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of minutes the u haul people are doing the most business of their lives, 0
i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof well have a hit on our hands the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film a mishmash collage of one dimensional characters rampant stereotypes of cultures and races cliched emotional statements of purpose and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography the story is loosely based around the pro football players strike in and a rag tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels keanu reeves stars as shane falco a has been football college player looking for redemption gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers rounding out the cast includes swingers jon favreau up pitchman orlando jones gruff owner jack warden and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters the drunken welshman the overweight sumo wrestler the black convict the violent cop and the dumb dumb cheerleaders this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from dennys the usual things happen like clockwork the hero rises from the ashes of failure the team comes together in unity the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax its also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks howard deutch who was behind the camera for two of the best films of s pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes obviously the problem is that without a good script any director will fail in the end sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds the rise and fall of gallant heroes and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life the replacements offers none of this, 0
knock off is exactly that a cheap knock off of an action movie its also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of but alas it has already been found jean claude van damme stars as i think a designer jeans executive who discovers his half brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods rob schneider plays van dammes partner and rochon plays actually i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there many things are not explained in this film but i do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick where chan comes off as endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his films van damme just comes off as a wimp were never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions to be more clear i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it was not made too clear the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong tsui hark who directed van dammes last movie the bad but not nearly as bad as this double team never lets the camera rest for a second and thats no exaggeration we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van dammes foot entering a shoe fabulous seriously though i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions as long as they dont get carried away for example look at sam raimi army of darkness one of his best movies features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story thats a concept that tsui cant seem to grasp the special effects and outrageous camera angles rule knock off to the point where the audience doesnt have a clue as to whats happening any more another problem with the film is that it looks cheap the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night and for some inexplicable reason everyones voice seems to have been dubbed even the stars and even the special effects seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent for example there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window the car slams into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed seconds later the car drives off at full speed hey i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but a line must be drawn somewhere finally the acting nobody gives a good performance in this film van damme an actor i usually like is way off the mark playing everyman and schneider here to provide comic relief i assume is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over the top performance as once again i have no idea who he was supposed to be in case i havent yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van dammes career and possibly the worst movie of the decade and its not even one of those movies thats so bad its funny its too inept to be funny there are no redeeming factors in knock off and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased, 0
one sided doom and gloom documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he along with best selling author hal lindsey discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent well for anyway events the film is dated badly as many things that are supposed to happen in the future never do for example the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year and cause chaos here on earth were still here the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick off the apocalypse were still here some of the more ludicrous moments come when its alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist also theres ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like if its anything like its depicted as here then its going to be incredibly boring the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video it contains the film in standard form aspect ratio of although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release chariots of the gods audio is mono dolby digital and the video is fair to good for a film like this i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me certainly i never expected a remastered print curiously the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case but theyre menu screens so who really cares pg, 0
movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good the bad and the despicable i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in but i wanted to re write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics we need to be warned about some truly awful films too this picture was so bad it inspired the description for my rating see ratings chart below the only thing saving it from a rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno so it does indeed have some plusses in fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff and her ability to whine and irritate us even while nude was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone this character is not smart not interesting and deliberately far too annoying far too often like in s bulworth when the movie was over i didnt care one little iota about the main character at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film though showgirls is too stupid to make a statement some people claim that the story is based on the legendary all about eve of all things if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l mankiewicz was hed be well hed be a good screenwriter instead this project may have sunk his career he wrote the ha ha script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed the same team who created a good sex film in basic instinct struck out here with their occasional violence gratuitous x rated sex scenes and numerous and quite unnecessary lesbian overtones the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer after the supposed street smart young lady gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack jawed yokel in the opening sequence she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the stardust hotel nomi doesnt take advantage of this contact to break into the big time of dirty dancing right away first she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club she sells her hot little wares at the cheetah for a short time turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience hey i never said she wasnt a hot number maybe its that her body which gets her into the big time when the star of the stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops into the strip club it certainly isnt her brains or pleasant disposition crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend kyle maclachlan he also happens to be the pleasure seeking worm who runs the big show crystal gets nomi onto the stardust team and after an interminable amount of time nomi earns the role of crystals understudy the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that shes not a whore thats a phrase we hear a few different times and its completely ludicrous of course she is she sells her soul to make it big but in the end were supposed to believe that shes a better person than that were supposed to root for her no way shes a tramp and a back stabber who deserved nothing least of all vindication in the ahem climax she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is the sub plot with a male dancer glenn plummer who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more it sure aint character development plummer also appeared in speed in in a smaller yet better role this sub plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay day or his standards have dipped since appearing in blue velvet that picture was weird but some critics claim its one of the best movies of the s now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the s too his sleazy character is important to showgirls but we dont learn anything about him he uses people to get what he wants but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie is he a villain who cares ultimately this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit everyone must know by now about the soft core acts of copulation especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool what few reviewers take issue with is how mean spirited this movie is everyones either having sex exacting revenge or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge its just too hard to take especially for over two hours if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world why couldnt verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers grunts and other sounds during the dance numbers its hard to care about these people if we cant even appreciate what theyre capable of doing on stage berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body after all the world of porn is still an active dishonourable profession perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford oops theyre bad actors too well at least theyre not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone useless trivia ironically elizabeth berkley played virtuous and holier than thou jessie on the teeny bopper tv show saved by the bell before breaking onto the big screen, 0
and now the high flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics and it isnt pretty this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer a version of dumass the three musketeers by bringing in popular asian actorstunt coordinator xing xing xiong whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting the end result is a tepid and dull actionadventure rip off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay dartagnan justin chambers is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents in paris he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu stephen rea who is trying to overthrow the king and richelieus man in black associate febre tim roth the killer of his folks he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk so he rounds up aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steven spiers to free the musketeers wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the kings prison dartagnan and his new frisky love interestchambermaid francesca mena suvari play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen catherine deneuve ends up being captured by the menancing febre forcing the musketeers to regroup with dartagnan leading the charge and save the day director peter hyams end of days obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles but here its a disaster one problem is that in reality most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones jet lis high risk is a rip off of die hard not the other way around ironically there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with to minute action sequences because they know the scenes have to carry the picture the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano sudden death horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers the wedding planner to deliver his mousy self as a leader chambers dartangnan isnt a musketeer hes a mouseketeer and hyams use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of th century paris are well noted but thats the only standout in an overall flat production, 0
my giant is two movies for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free as lamely directed by michael lehmann the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book without goliath david is just some punk throwing rocks languidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer the omen meanders toward its sad ending since its rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery other than a few nice visuals theres nothing to recommend the picture with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally to the original city slickers billy crystal has shown that hes more than the worlds best oscar host he does however have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last years fathers day and this years my giant one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movies somber tone the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day this one joke movies single idea is to place real life basketball player gheorghe muresan who stands seven and a half feet tall into as many visually striking situations as possible sammy crystal an agent currently without clients is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max muresan after throwing out constant one liners either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car sammy decides to get serious seeing max as his meal ticket and although he doesnt like it hes willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half dozen dwarfs the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever after a series of missed opportunities the comedic part of the movie is over and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie we learn that maxs condition is terminal and he will soon die to be fair the movie does contain a few good scenes all of which you can see in the trailers lets hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie my giant runs too long even at just it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up my son jeffrey and his friend matthew both gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it matthew pointed out that it is not as good as it could have been or should have been amen he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was, 0
