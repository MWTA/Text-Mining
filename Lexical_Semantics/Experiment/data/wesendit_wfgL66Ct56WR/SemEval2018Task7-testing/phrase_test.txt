For the results, term weight learning is performed.
The results of experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

This paper describes unsupervised learning algorithm for disambiguating verbal word senses using term weight learning.
In our method, collocations which characterise every sense are extracted using similarity-based estimation. 

To identify active region arguments,this paper models Maximal Projection (MP), which is a concept in D-structure from the projection principle of the Principle and Parameters theory.
As the number of necessary bilingual dictionaries is a quadratic function of the number of languages considered, we will face the problem of getting a large number of dictionaries.
