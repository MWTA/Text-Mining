zero effect gets its title from the main character daryl zero bill pullman although we dont understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film zero is a private investigator perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived at least hed like to think so however hes a socially inept being and eccentric in every possible way this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are zeros accomplice is steve arlo ben stiller a normal guy who does the business side of the job hes the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zeros greatness as an investigator the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zeros talents to soon to be client gregory stark ryan oneal it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about zero takes the case and the plot thickens his path leads to a young pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan kim dickens despite her luminous and seemingly harmless presence she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark through his investigations zero learns why but not without developing feelings for gloria feelings that because of his reclusive behavior are new and confusing to him i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators and every once in a while a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away actually no private eye film has ever reached chinatowns greatness zero effect which is jake kasdans first effort as writerdirector is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts its an original funny and completely involving motion picture with so many cliches available to this genre i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them but he didnt just successfully avoid flaws he has created a great film here one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment take for starters the great cast of characters pullman is terrific as zero showing a comic flair that i really havent seen from him since spaceballs zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here the fact that hes an almost exaggeratedly twisted emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe pullmans performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance and the occasional voice over as hes going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious ben stiller is also a very funny individual hes the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny ill shoot you he says to stark at one point i have a gun and everything his character is also well drawn with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend angela featherstone who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job oneal also gives his character a bit of depth and kim dickens last seen and underused in mercury rising gets a chance to show us her talent here giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film kasdans humor is of the best kind soft spoken and mostly dialogue driven though there are some great visual jokes its the kind of humor thats funny even after youve seen it five or six times theres one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is an how that makes him such a great detective what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed or standing motionlessly with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face his eyes pointing to something off camera but obviously to nothing in particular i cant convey to you how funny this is but what makes it great film making is that it has a point scenes like this are frequent and they provide solid characterization of zero as a side note i dont consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy not to sound elitist i find things funny that many do not and vice versa there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it i have a feeling the humor here wont appeal to everyone but theres certainly enough story and character development to keep anyones interest jake kasdan son of writerdirector lawrence kasdan is only years old i found this out after seeing the film and i cant remember ever being so impressed with a film maker his direction is stylish without being pretentious and his writing is mature full and developed zero effect is the kind of film that ill buy for my collection smart original films like this are rare as it is but this one actually has a heart and a soul at the end of the film i was involved in the characters and i was satisfied with the outcome and with kasdans undeniable talent at such a young age all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future, 1
comedy rated pg runs about starring john goodman kathy moriarty and a bunch of teenagers directed by joe dante and written by charles hass summary lawrence woolsley john goodman brings his new horror film mant to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them quick and easy review i really enjoyed matinee the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely unlike many comedies this film tries and succeeds in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story the performances of all the principals are right on the mark particularly john goodman as the schlock master so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours longer more detailed review beware of spoilers the primary reason i enjoyed this film was that while being a comedy the film also had an intelligent story to tell too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh you watch the movie laugh a lot leave the theatre and take nothing with you matinee is not like that i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film but most importantly i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters the comedy of the film centers around goodman his character and the film he brings to key west i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today he is highly expressive both physically and vocally i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature however while the star goodman is actually not at the center of the film the movie is really the story of the four teenagers discovering who they are and what they want against a background where at any minute it could all end i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic they tried to block it out they tried to escape from the concerns of their world unfortunately it kept creeping back in particularly with the fear and the chaos of the time while the comedy centered on goodman and the drama on the teens there was a great deal of overlap several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy but it works here another reason i like this film is that i like b science fiction movies one of my favorite films to go watch is plan from outer space note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies but one of my favorite to see while mant never got made many films like it were and mant serves mostly as dantes homage to the b films he loves so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good humorous story this isnt a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent well thought out film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way enjoy, 1
hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death no pun intended honest its a shame too because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b movie monsters i mean come on are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour hell no and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well not commonly associated with horror films and not only has the idea been done too many times but with the possible exception of from dusk till dawn has not been done very well lately either this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu i got to go back to the times when making movies even horror movies was considered an art form and not just done to make cash like nowadays and that is exactly what this film is art ive been a horror fan since i was eight years old and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers let me backtrack a minute when i say intellectual ground i dont mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to a little bit of thinking is involved with most modern slasher movies like friday the th and what not you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen you see this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore this is a thinking mans slasher flick the nosferatu of the title is orlock max shreck a strange hermit like count that as the film opens is looking for a new home to buy he employs the help of hutter gustav von wangenhein a real estate salesman or something to that effect who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen greta schroeder upon orders from his boss hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlocks castle and speak to him about his new home which just happens to be right next door to hutters the next morning he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck not really a good sign he then discovers through some reading that the count is a nosferatu or vampire one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans but by the time he pieces this together he is too late orlock has already embarked to hutters hometown via boat will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock the character of orlock is of course dracula the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strockers novel just thought that was an interesting little side note probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainments digitally restored cut now available in stores however this version is quite different than maunaus original masterpiece the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o negative and color tinting much like the version of langs metropolis now i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one but alas i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen but thats just my bag you may like the newer more modern version better either way i suggest investing your money in a copy if you like what they have done with it pop it in the vcr and enjoy if youre like me just do what ill do during future viewings turn the color all the way down on your television hit mute turn on some bach or mozart or whatever dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made, 1
theres something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days stiller currently has three projects in circulation and what other actor can lay claim to that hes in theres something about mary which i still havent seen and hes in the acerbic your friends neighbors playing a talkative sexually frustrated drama coach called jerri now theres permanent midnight in which stiller plays another jerry this one a heroin addicted television writer last name stahl theres also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug addiction pictures the minute theyve proved themselves commercially ewan mcgregor springs to mind who after successful turns in emma and brassed off received greater respect and admiration for his mind blowing realization as renton in danny boyles transatlantic junk fest trainspotting the philosophy appears to be a simple one if you want em to be taken seriously make em do drugs permanent midnight is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl a successful hollywood writer who in the mid eighties had a a week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a a week heroin habit a habit in stahls own words the size of utah as stahl stiller contributes a commanding performance unlike trainspotting which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse permanent midnight instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to naked lunch author william s burroughs who when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds so i can shave stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in permanent midnight its so he can talk to his mother on the phone show up for work on time even pay his bills while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl the writing adapted from stahls autobiography by director david veloz is controlled and pointed permanent midnight shows how stahl moved from new york to l a to again in the authors words escape the drug scene yeah right why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec elizabeth hurley so impossibly polite youd swear her single profanity was dubbed and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty norristowns own maria bello with whom he spent some rehab time janeane garofalo is wasted and miscast as a heavily bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped up wordsmith and thats stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor stiller unshaven burroughs take note and with lots of mascara around the eyes has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but to his credit never once pushes his pill popping needle jabbing performance over the top the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see permanent midnight a dark comic and strangely absorbing study of assisted living, 1
the event of events is upon us people have waited twenty two years for the prequel to star wars and die hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it i dont think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history anyone who tells you its just a movie is either lying or clueless it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz which is far too weak a word that star wars epsode i the phantom menace so effortlessly generated but that does not mean that the film itself is bad in fact it is terrific i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash it is set some decades before the events of the original star wars took place the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo the republic sent two jedi knights people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as the force qui gon jinn liam neeson and obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor to negotiate unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine where they meet the movies real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd he is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong with him so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi as any self respecting star wars fan should know anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actors movie around of the characters if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effects are seamless the movie lacks soul i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far with plenty of broad comic relief to go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar jar binks hes essentially a computer animated sidekick who says things like exqueeze me and mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying the visual effects are astounding although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them and the movie is a thrilling triumph if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement the climactic lightsaber battle oh come on as if you didnt already know among other things is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie what made me surrender and give this movie stars was the score by john williams even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days his work here is nothing short of brilliant his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia when you see a long time ago in a galaxy far far away when the familiar music plays when the words star wars appear on screen youll feel a tingle even if you didnt see the movie when it first came out in it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin a boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not we not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like were seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years the phantom menace although lacking in human aspects of the story is a very worthy installment in the star wars it works as an action flick visually eye popping and often paralyzingly exciting it also works as an elicitor of memories a piece of exquisite nostalgia eugene novikov, 1
warning contains what the matrix is rated r for sci fi violence starring keanu reeves laurence fishburne joe panteliano some may be disappointed with the matrix ill tell you i was i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen now wait wait i know most of you loved it and im not saying i didnt like it what im saying is the first half was extremely slow now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show dont be fooled this movie has a big story and big chunks of talky moments but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par deserving the rating above ok now to the story well this may take a while ok first of all our world we live in now is not the real world actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world he does so and finds out that he can do anything be anything he wants to be but he has to fight a matrix skipping bad guy who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him laurence fishburne his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were yeah there were some in the first half but not enough the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie now for the second half it is explosive and saves the movie some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking the sound the music and all the effects were effective and the last hour kept us entertained but with a running time of hours and minutes this movie is at least minutes too long one would have wished for a better matrix but i do have to say i did like it and i was entertained, 1
having not seen who framed roger rabbit in over years and not remembering much besides that i liked it then i decided to rent it recently watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is aside from the fact that its a milestone in animation in movies its the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters have them interact and make it convincingly real and a great entertainment its also quite an effective comedymystery while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original especially baby herman and watching them together is a lot of fun the story begins in hollywood in cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work so hard boiled private detective eddie valiant bob hoskins is called in by studio head r k maroon alan tilvern to try to help get rogers mind back on work maroon thinks that rogers wife jessicas possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots valiant takes some photos of jessica playing patty cake with marvin acme stubby kaye the owner of toontown where all of the cartoon characters live and takes them to maroon upon seeing them roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town and eventually toontown trying to clear rogers good name along the way they meet judge doom christopher lloyd a judge jury and executioner type whos out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a toon who framed roger rabbit won academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production which included hundreds of animators also bob hoskins performance should be credited he in addition to the rest of the human cast finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co stars according to the internet movie database hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off who framed roger rabbit is a rare film one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom do yourself a favor and rent it p p p p please, 1

just how inseparable is the team of sgt martin riggs mel gibson and sgt roger murtaugh danny glover lets just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction his partner actually does it the familiar lethal weapon family is back including rene russo who is now the expectant mother of riggs child and joe pesci as the soprana like foul mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye new to the team is chris rock also a fast talking up and coming detective trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go and in this film that is no exception even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship we here some ominous music which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen gunfire ensues and when its all over the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord although they dont know what theyre looking for their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action and theres plenty of action here for two movies led by fighting sensation jet li whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to li is ruthless in his approach will kill anyone just to make a point and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives there are terrific car chases explosions and gunshot galore its a summer action recipe followed to the letter and the result is nothing less than pure unadulterated summer fun but even too many explosions can get boring to counter that we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li luckily hed rather fight hand to hand instead of firing off guns meanwhile when the detectives arent reloading their guns or running from fireballs theyre engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets everybody gets in on the shtick russo screams during her delivery the crime lord has a few funny bits when hes being interrogated while being given laughing gas and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano score one for the old guard, 1
jaws is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen the movie opens with blackness and only distant alien like underwater sounds then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score dah dum from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip perhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie he works it like a theatrical production with a first act and a second act unlike so many modern filmmakers he has a great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act until then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music hes building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the sharks arrival is truly terrifying he doesnt let us get bored with the imagery the first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider a new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in years the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money brody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss a young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark its a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaws is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror it is like ten movies all rolled into one and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in by star wars even today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks psycho and it never seems to age although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill the technical limitations faced by spielberg in may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town its your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz gives a surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers however most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards bordering of parody shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism hes slightly deranged and shaws performance is almost a caricature however there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u s s indianapolis a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film of course we cant leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are a threat every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark a bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into the shark in jaws was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles many have forgotten but jaws was a sort of precursor to waterworld a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb but as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood, 1
accepting his oscar as producer of this years best picture winner saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over one could almost say the same about his much prized film rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery symbolism ideas and metaphors complex and literate storytelling all possessed of an intelligence that invites even demands constant scrutiny an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth in short the antithesis of all things hollywood yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind ralph fiennes is the title character an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory and particularly the memory of love is the ostensible focus of the film but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld the same can easily be said for every other character in the film of which there are too many juliette binoches nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious disfigured dying stranger even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion however that it verges on the comical with so many characters enjoying so little screen time the films minutes can be taxing yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldnt help but feel that greatness was in the air hints of it were everywhere in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern day swimmer in the sahara in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years but ultimately the emotional truths writer director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed in the end i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron a haunting bore bore is perhaps too strong a word but after drinking in the rich production values the cup remains only slightly over half full, 1
apparently director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film american history x i dont know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether ive heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce as it is i found american history x to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of a powerful charismatic performance from edward norton its hard to believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself a star norton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year he plays a young man named derek vinyard a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly dangelo and sister davin jennifer lien the film opens with a flashback in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car we find out that this lands him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny in the present time of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother much of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that leads to dereks adoption of white supremacy when derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms its hard to make a controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material because american history x is a mainstream film there has to be a redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic i partially disagree with this because although i do not advocate racism in any way its interesting the way kaye presents derek he is a loud obnoxious man but hes also very smart the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men its clear that hes passionate about his beliefs and that hes not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up of course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part its astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest in addition to getting the look just right hes perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and a whole lot of shouting and norton does it all with ease even when hes at his meanest derek has a likable quality to him and thats a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of dannys school avery brooks becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny the other performances are all terrific with standouts from furlong dangelo and lien visually the film is very powerful kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere but like a lot of movies lately american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes although the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends with a pretentious preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way it makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film perhaps this last scene was the problem its hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good in a time when so many movies are timid and weak american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way, 1
the most common and in many cases the only complaint against francis ford coppolas masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder ages martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down to earth vision of mafia in mean streets movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime unfortunately for scorsese his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppolas influence on mafia portrayals in the movies seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime this film was goodfellas epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of s goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi who would co write the screenplay for the film the book as well as the film chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill played by ray liotta irish italian criminal from new york at the age of he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played by paul sorvino local mob boss and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands after couple of years together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito played by joe pesci he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway played by robert de niro three of them spend years as best friends and associates gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history wealth influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen played by lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities domestic abuse arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business but the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begins to fall apart tommys unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence jimmys reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and finally henrys own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history based on some notorious real life events the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens scorsese also manages to break viewers moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material scenes that depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience with the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shots characters dialogue or narrators commentary goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era even if we dont pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker first we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used as movies ironic prologue then instead of single narrator scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards this multiple points of views both in terms of narration and various subjective shots only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening s pop songs while depression paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late s and s but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed however thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people such scenes although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings became very popular among other directors in s fragmentary character of the screenplay which doesnt have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese he uses this structure of film to experiment and most successful of such experiments is hilarious a day in life segment near the end of the film another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents the most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues joe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his lines including ad libs probably represent the most memorable element of the film ray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesnt look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film liottas henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs liotta on the other hand improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction lorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable as karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave as a combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time because of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of s, 1
a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july from ace ventura to truman burbank jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic yet sympathetic characters s the cable guy was supposed to be his big breakthrough role from zany humor into darker more dramatic acting as most everyone knows the results were well less than stellar not only did the film not do so hot at the box office but it was also panned by critics as far as i know gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it the first time i saw the cable guy in theatres i was in super critic mode and didnt really like it however due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day ive had time to lean back relax and take in the film and to my surprise it grew on me the plot is rather simple broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy played by carrey then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship see stevens been having some problems with his girlfriend robin leslie mann and he doesnt think he has any more room in his life for a new friend also some of the cable guys antics have been creeping him out carrey as the cable guy gives steven various aliases which later we find out are all tv characters larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc he apparently lives in his cable van and while many critics didnt enjoy this newer darker less manic performance from carrey i thought it was interesting and rather well done for me its not the movie as a whole thats enjoyable but rather several individual scenes a karaoke jam at stevens apartment a medieval fight at a theme restaurant and a bathroom beating a la liar liar just to name a few perhaps the fact that more of carreys humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny and if you really want to see something youve got to hear his version of jefferson airplanes somebody to love sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam the cable guy has its bad spots like most any movie i didnt particularly like stevens girlfriend and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend also the ending while having you fooled for a moment is rather contrived and somewhat dissapointing still i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture if youre at the video store and cant think of anything to rent i suggest you try it out or if you have hbo just wait till it comes on you wont have to wait long hell thats what i do every day, 1
warning anyone offended by blatant leering machismo had better avoid this film or lots of blood guts men against men and mano et mano stuff in other words its a walter hill film with a john milius script i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm wrestling matches these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb and we got tough guys galore here drug running banditos by the dozens all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill tempered overall a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover up supposedly any connection between the government and the drug runners and lots of shit kicking texas dirt farmers whod as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you in particular we got nick nolte as one hard ass texas ranger powers boothe as the drug kingpin michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army and rip torn as the local sheriff torn is the sympathetic figure of the group he smiles before shooting anyone as to women well ive never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film and at this rate i doubt i ever will women exist here to look good comfort the man and get argued over gosh just like the old days frankly this is a pretty good movie if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff the cinematography is excellent the cast of characters is broad and has texture the script is quite good and the film lets you keep up with whats happening yourself without spelling it out to you i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up finally theres lots of sam peckinpah slow motion shoot ups, 1
the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest little caper adventure entitled where the money is the elderly bank robber is henry paul newman a famous criminal that was only recently caught he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune always the shrewd thinker he begins working on a plan to get out of jail this involves years of studying buddhism and self hypnosis when he is prepared to execute his plan he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke now a seemingly twitching vegetable he is temporarily transferred to a state run home carol linda fiorentino is the nurse that cares for him shes a very bright person with a good heart yet her life is a miserable waste of time the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics worse shes in a dead end relationship with high school sweetheart wayne dylan mcdermott they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom to her this made sense long ago but now its a different story wayne seems equally bored with his life but is content enough to stay put waynes greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients but shes never been anywhere else and doesnt see many other opportunities in life however when henry falls under her care her outlook begins to change the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke carol however begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all maybe she can get through to him and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away the opening minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry back to life and what are some of carols resuscitation techniques perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses if that fails maybe shell try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a foot high pier into the cold lake below when he finally comes out of his state of self trance the movies direction changes though it remains equally if not more entertaining carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self assuredness she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy this of course puts wayne in an odd situation henry and carols bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash meanwhile this is carols ticket to a better life wayne is uncomfortable with the situation but helps out nonetheless however his lack of commitment threatens their success the heist sequence is suspenseful well paced and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong where the money is does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist newman is the real joy of the film adroitly showing that at age hes still really hot stuff he possesses a sly smile displays a dominating attitude and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive fiorentino is also a fun presence you root for her despite her sense of amorality sure she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair stricken man into a lake but we can see that to escape her dead end world she needs to do something drastic with two charismatic characters such as these its hard to ignore that where the money is is where the fun is, 1
the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire fu copycats its not a pretty death and its leaving the likes of schwartznager stallone and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea sometimes the mix results in a mind blowing spectacle unlike any other quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work as in s the matrix can be a real gem but too often hollywood gets it wrong even when they pay off chinese directors flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists mostly its laughable in hollywoods rush to emulate the success of the matrix trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form but iron monkey the latest asian import shows us how to get it right iron monkey actually a reissue of a film is the story of a th chinese vigilante rongguang yu fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei hong most recently seen in one of the most overlooked and possibly best films of drunken master released in the u s as the legend of drunken master unlike drunken master which stars jackie chan as an adult fei hong iron monkey finds a much younger fei hong sze man tsang and his father wong kei ying yen chi dan thrust into the middle of iron monkeys fight against oppression iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master at times fighting styles especially that of monkey himself do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle toed floating of films like crouching tiger hidden dragon director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger however there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good hearted but misguided enemy chief fox in those moments and in others iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune aka siunin wong fei hung tsi titmalau, 1
synopsis bobby garfield yelchin lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother hope davis bobbys world revolves around his friends especially the spritely carol boorem then one day a new boarder arrives at bobbys house ted brautigan hopkins is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking as the bond between bobby and ted deepens bobby becomes privy to teds great secret an event which will change both of their lives forever review a small but enchanting movie hearts in atlantis easily recalls another king inspired coming of age film stand by me both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys hearts is a tribute to the magic of childhood to those summers when the days seem neverending and nothing means more than your closest friends unlike stand by me there is a supernatural element to hearts but although it is key to the plot it is not prominent like stand by me this is a mostly character driven film and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting yelchin is very good as bobby finding a good mix of innocence and resignation more splendid still is boorem whom i praised highly for her work in along came a spider and who is simply radiant here as carol and then there is hopkins who despite playing such a quiet introspective character as ted nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen less successful is davis whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish i also found it odd that bobby and carols other friend sully whose death as an adult sets up the movies flashback framing device is paid virtually no attention but hicks direction is lovely without being cloying and despite the movies general lack of incident it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience, 1
carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion made in it still features most of the regulars of this genre sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac hattie jacques re takes her role as matron and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr goode the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard this time williams is after matron jacques when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr goode the doctor hawtrey is sworn to secrecy i assure you that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself there are great cameos from joan sims an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks hes at work at the railway station sid james gang including cyril his son kenneth cope try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home he has to share a room with nurse ball barbara windsor and she soon sees through him the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospitals pills with panic ensuing there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous matrons williams is as usual on top form but sid james isnt given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all the same does not go for charles hawtrey for although he only first appears in the movie after minutes gone and has scarce screen time he seems to steal every scene he is in by not making use of sid james and barbara windsors talent to full effect the film seems to flounder but it certainly makes up for it with its good storyline and its other appealing characters this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored, 1
sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest some people call it original or artsy or abstract some people simply call it trash a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings definitely a generation x aimed movie a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke based musical dream sequence whew anyone in their s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film its somewhat silly its somewhat outrageous and its definitely not your typical romance story but for the right audience it works a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting well sorry folks but i havent seen trainspotting so i cant really compare whether that works in this films favor or not is beyond me but i do know this ewan mcgregor whom i had never had the pleasure of watching definitely charmed me he was great cameron diazs character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp the audience may find it difficult to care about her thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him misguided you bet loveable you bet a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city utah this was just one more thing i didnt know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise but i think even if i had known i would have been just as happy a life less ordinary is quirky eccentric and downright charming not for everyone but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies, 1

com reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video here is a sample review welcome to sarajevo in light of americas recent intervention in kosovo welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years set in sarajevo and based on actual events this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding as they make their way down the street a sniper shoots the mother of the bride yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war in this scene we meet joe flynn woody harrelson an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church joe is cocky but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesnt even know his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson stephen dillane michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the worlds lack of interest henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mothers death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread he decides to take action when a united nations delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult during his visits he befriends a pre teen girl emira emira nuseric who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner he promises to get emira out of harms way if he gets the chance after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children henderson loses hope however his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina marisa tomei and her childrens aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans unfortunately only babies are wanted for adoption so henderson pledges to take emira to england the group of children nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps the movie was beautifully and sensitively made director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred they show the destroyed lives families that have been split up and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson his producer and flynn have befriended the group of twenty somethings reside in a bombed out bar without lifes simplest pleasures and amenities one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth like the rest of those deeply effected by the war this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the olympics winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies com selection mad city we watch them struggle to cover the horror while trying to remain professionally detached however they are human and question the reason behind it all why no one cares and how they can get out stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy henderson realizes that he cannot save the world but he can help a few it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary sandra bullock disaster two if by sea woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest most versatile actors of his generation harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the characters caring nature and vulnerability shine through harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men cheers white men cant jump as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one this ability will serve him well and give him a long successful career americas involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict the entire movie most importantly the opening scenes provide a history lesson war is a foreign concept to most of us in america battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world something we dont do enough of in s america, 1
call it touched by a demon gregory hoblits fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual horrific twist if marketed properly this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven in fact theres even a little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lions share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob the biggest failing of fallen is that although its consistently interesting its not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope a serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him to justice now during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around shortly thereafter he begins to sing time is on my side as hes taken on his last walk minutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead but for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasnt a normal psychopath he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel and with reeses death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will only hobbes and a pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what theyre up against the rest of the cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini a newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland dont have a clue and as a result they are in mortal danger as depicted by hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is a dark dreary place a gothic city rather than a modern one no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown the most famous landmark to appear isnt the liberty bell or independence hall its genos steaks shadows and night scenes abound the days are cloudy and unpromising this is the kind of setting where its easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men fallens plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized somehow i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise but the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual of the several dozen actors to play azazel the best is by far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives a fantastically charged performance john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick sadly however these two are the only ones who excel everyone else including denzel washington is boring washingtons flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film its not that hes bad per se but hes not very interesting theres no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was washingtons subdued approach is part of the reason for this i never felt a sense of urgency however at least washington was believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindlers list and donald sutherland to be fair the flaws in their characters arent all acting related neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written that said however theres nothing inspired about either davidtzs or sutherlands work both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi dimensional individual narratively fallen has a few glaring weaknesses although the plot proceeds with a convoluted game like structure it uses a denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters at times this is actually helpful and it has a use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become a little hard to swallow in addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel however despite the negatives im still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending which i loved the final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected its not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself this is not a great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are its a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours and whatever you do dont walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll, 1
the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do lives are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at a moments notice the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being a police officer he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower most of all the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants it takes a pretty smart person to do that but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart what if hes also able to think on his feet in fact what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f gary grays the negotiator in this film police negotiator danny roman samuel l jackson is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in romans home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder faced with the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny by the media roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captains office i dont quite remember if the captain actually said i hate to do this but although it wouldnt surprise me if he did luckily the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above after being offered a take it or leave it deal by the district attorney roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum j t walsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he has been framed although romans actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue jackson while a superb actor is miscast in the role of roman the actor has become so popular and so often identified as a protagonist notable exceptions can be found such as in jackie brown that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence how can we believe hes going to shoot a hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier unfortunately this preconception saps the film of some of its would be suspenseful moments and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jacksons acting ability almost every time hes in a scene jackson steals it without looking back when spacey appears the film has already run about a third of its course his is an interesting character made out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower but i cant talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says when he gets the call to action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be soon his character has to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in a team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiations fail this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor as the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely gray really lucked out with this cast david morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played a similar role in the rock rifkin played the d a in l a confidential and spencer played a police detective in cop land with the level of acting however this can be forgiven also in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides his character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even says anything fortunately this doesnt distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout j t walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in with one of his final performances sadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon for one of his best performances check out sling blade in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success the actors performed together in a few good men the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing in the end the negotiator has a plotline that parallels its reality were served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best as an audience were also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie and wed like to see if one will dominate the film both provide some pretty good entertainment, 1

up until about a year ago john travoltas career consisted of those look whos talking movies notice how they never called them look whos talented and the bomb shout which was bad enough to make most people scream but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in would experience fame and fortune once again while barry robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a straight to the cutout bin album aptly named size isnt everything and of course they learned that sales are everything but now travoltas back on the hollywood scene once again and i think we all know why four words contract with the devil and this has nothing to do with newt gingrichs contract with america no satan is much more humane anyway yes travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld how do i know i own the document in question amazing what you can buy at those collectors shops for a few hundred dollars isnt it get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction with travolta as crime minion chili palmer he goes to collect some of the mafias money from a b grade director gene hackman and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game sure a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood but i guess thats beside the point palmer is determined to get hackmans next project made so he sets out to convince big star martin weir danny devito to star in the movie bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores rene russo who has already had affairs with hackman and devito it doesnt take a las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well after the customary sexual tension and denial which has been used in every comedy from whos the boss to speechless it works in this case unlike whos the boss although its interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackmans other films and want in on this one too along with travoltas mob boss trying to track him down for defecting get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction despite the obvious similarities this movie doesnt have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year yes even better than halloween vi get shorty is my kind of movie one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence im definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on are you getting this shorty, 1
when star wars came out some twenty years ago the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars we see constellations meteor showers and cool space ships when han solo goes light speed the stars change to bright lines going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point cool october sky offers a much simpler image that of a single white dot traveling horizontally across the night sky was it really only forty years ago when sputnik was launched and that before then no satellites ever existed have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then technological achievement even though it was from the russians it sounds hokey but when that scene occurs near the beginning of october sky i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam played by jake gyllenhaal determined to make a dent in the space race he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket when lovely teacher miss riley played by laura dern suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair we know exactly who is going to win but the joy in a film like this is in the little details for example homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class if he has any strengths whatsoever it is an undeterring vision and a good organizer it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school who knows more about rocket science than he does it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property that is the entire coal mining town he must walk eight miles one way just to set up the rockets which will fail fail fail and fail again homers dad is played by chris cooper a favorite actor of mine since lone star here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in matewan instead of organizing union rallies he is the head of the coal miners who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year note how multi dimensional his character is he is his sons last nemesis as one who most likely interferes with his sons dreams but he truly loves his son and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how through coal mining because of his character we can see how far weve come the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us we dont understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family the paradigm was shifting under the fathers feet and he knew of no other life so october sky far from being merely a feel good inspirational film offers much food for thought and this is the best type of inspirational film the one that you take something with you btw the final image of the film is just as simple is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal moving white dot against the night sky background another commonplace image to be sure but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago, 1
for many people procrastination isnt a problem to overcome its a high art well do just about anything to put off a task when the deadline for this column nears its the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and eventually hopefully sometimes theres a breakthrough and we actually get down to work amazingly its almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away and then the next time we do it all again english professor grady tripp michael douglas is a master seven years ago his first book was a hit hes been working on his second a short page piece since then fearful that he cant live up to the first he cant bring himself to finish it no writers block hes nearing pages with no end in sight now hes having a particularly difficult day the colleges annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing their books during the first day his wife has left him his married girlfriend informs him shes pregnant and his agent is in town with a six foot transvestite in tow by the evening our besieged writer is driving though the snow covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk this could be a pivotal point in his mid life crisis and then theres the next morning theres a lot to like about this movie there are no huge explosions shattering glass or computer generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career in the world of what have you done for me lately he knows his second book has to be better than his first instead of finding out he drifts comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood he doesnt have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer tobey maguire james may be suicidal and psychotic certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isnt interesting enough as the weekend progresses they are both forced to fully engage life thats the question they must face comfort or real experiences the film takes some interesting chances non traditional relationships are presented as matter of fact extra marital gay interracial professor student here they arent judged merely choices the actors are all first rate douglas triumphs playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled unshaven and clad in a pink womens house robe maguires disengaged alienation works perfectly here robert downey jr as gradys agent livens up his scenes director curtis hanson l a confidential makes a few missteps the women are underused frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara gradys married lover but we never understand much of who she is the chemistry between the two of them is non existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor but her character goes nowhere we never even see gradys exiting wife this is very much a guys film the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others gradys alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film not him and sara as the boomers age expect to see more mid life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic eventually itll probably become cliche but right now weve got a winner ill finish this in a second right now i have to grab some paint i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch up michael redman has written this column for so long that hes made mid life crisis a career choice, 1
on june a self taught idealistic yet pragmatic young man became at age the first head of government of a newly independent african state formerly the belgian congo two months later he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides this little known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in lumumba patrice lumumbas eriq ebouaney story has been told previously by helmer peck in his award winning documentary lumumba death of a prophet virtually guaranteeing that his new fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject peck with co writer pascal bonitzer begins at the end of the story of the young political leader we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men images of hatchets saws and fast emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian owned congo a third class postal worker lumumba speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes proclaiming himself not tribal not regional but a national leader his small mobile party the congolese national movement mnc is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer and get his face known in the bustling capital stanleyville at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world lumumba is in the right place at the right time and through political savvy and chess like manipulation achieves a position of leadership of the mnc as the date for independence approaches he tactically positions himself to be the new nations first prime minister and defense minister supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu maka kotto the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the countrys vast natural resources of copper diamonds gold and more lumumba wont seek the help of the us knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves belgian troops violently intervene the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe pascal nzonzi and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the s and s during the time the story takes place many new nations including nigeria and somalia were born with varying degrees of success and failure usually dependent upon which country colonized them some colonial masters were better than others the effort involved in lumumba is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades if at all production values are first rate on what must be a small by us standards budget the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeomans work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumbas life the political side of things is evenly told in a linear straightforward manner that teaches not preaches it concentrates on the good deeds of the man if a bit as a stalwart saint but doesnt embellish on a larger than life persona the family side of patrices life is handled in several perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child i know the intent is to flesh the man out but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba the story as such has a lopsided feel about it high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character the actor gives a convincing charismatic performance as the multifaceted politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions in true docudrama tradition the supporting cast does not outshine the star complementing his good efforts instead lumumba is a solid interesting educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos both it has more intelligence in its telling than anything ive seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b, 1
every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio with every indication that it will be a stinker and to everybodys surprise perhaps even the studio the film becomes a critical darling mtv films election a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is a current example did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened the plot is deceptively simple george washington carver high school is having student elections tracy flick reese witherspoon is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question way way high mr m matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul a popular but slow jock to run and pauls nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well for personal reasons the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectations were so low going in the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be you cant help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have election a good film does not live up to its hype what makes election so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from rushmore released a few months earlier the similarities are staggering tracy flick election is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play max fischer rushmore is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play the most significant tension of election is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student the most significant tension of rushmore is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student tracy flick is from a single parent home which has contributed to her drive max fischer is from a single parent home which has contributed to his drive the male bumbling adult in election matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he even gets a bee sting the male bumbling adult in rushmore bill murray pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he gets several bee stings and so on what happened how is it that an individual screenplay rushmore and a novel election contain so many significant plot points and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studios from a genre the high school geeks revenge movie that hadnt been fully formed yet even so the strengths of election rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell as pauls anti social sister tammy broderick here is playing the mr rooney role from ferris bueller and he seems to be having the most fun hes had since then witherspoon is a revelation its early in the year its a comedy and teenagers have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination and once campbells character gets going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then youre won over one thing thats been bothering me since ive seen it there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film i suppose that coming from mtv films i should expect no less but the film starts off light and airy like a sitcom as the screws tighten and the tensions mount alexander payne decides to add elements that frankly distract from the story it is bad enough that mr m doesnt like tracys determination to win at all costs but did they have to throw in the studentteacher relationship even so theres no logical reason why mr m has an affair when he does theres a lot to like in election but the plot similarities to rushmore and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven mark this as a disappointment, 1
the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchables is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry based on the television show of the same title the untouchables may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences some excellent acting a memorable score and a clever script the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order however as ness soon learns in order to stabilize peace you have to bend a few laws the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes the film begins with capone played perfectly by deniro declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capones men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl from this point we know capone is evil not only because he kills without hesitation but also because he is a lying bastard right from the first five minutes of the film de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs this developed hatred is before the films hero ness is even introduced i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone the film only gets better from this point with the formation of the untouchables there is a group of men wearing long dark overcoats and hats they walk in unison and they only look forward as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films one that comes to mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world wearing more futuristic outfits of the same s style the similarities between these two are countless the untouchables has some of the hippest bravest heroes in any action film the four members were the only ones willing to go against capones army each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others elliot ness played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner is a character that surely grows during the course of the film he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be however as the film develops so does ness his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in sean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role plays malone an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables malone acts as a mentor to ness he teaches him the chicago way to do things when they attack with a knife you attack with a gun connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone a young man who is just becoming a police officer as ness grows he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen also very similar to the matrix they are exciting and intense from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps the scenes are well thought out and well executed the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting great directing and great action some scenes capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid, 1
ive noticed something lately that ive never thought of before pseudo substance hollywood faking deep meanings in their films have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing more and more filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff im not trying to say city of angels is that bad it had a lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered somehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography the predictable ending that shattered our hopes even though we saw it coming only added to the disappointment but for over an hour city of angels is well worth the time nicolas cage is seth a guardian angel who like hundreds likely thousands or even millions of other angels spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life meg ryan in her most subdued performance yet plays maggie a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is were fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive after losing a patient on the surgery table these questions envelope maggie and seth the angel who was there to oversee the patients transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated by the doctor he begins following and observing maggie falling more and more in love with her everyday angels who we quickly learn are not and never were humans can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire seths adoration is too much to resist and eventually he does appear to maggie quite regularly although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community the angels are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities but its a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness cage is a wonderfully versatile actor think faceoff raising arizona and it could happen to you what a combo who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once its nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire the two arent very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy roles and its an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy but even though the two leads do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye its a shame that with so much going for it city of angels falters so much in its final stages leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there they just didnt know quite how to get to it they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling us for minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths based on the german film wings of desire that being the english title of course city of angels is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings even the devastatingly disappointing ending most movie goers the non cynics anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized nonetheless city of angels is beautifully captivating which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories, 1
earth is a harsh unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets indian and pakistani muslim hindu sikh parsee the story takes place in lahore which was indian before partition and pakistani afterward regardless of what its citizens might call themselves the action is seen through the eyes of lenny maaia sethna a young parsee girl but it is really about her nanny shanta shanta has a small circle of male admirers two of the men are suitors hasan rahul khanna a hindu and dil navaz aamir khan a muslim the others sikh hindu muslim are older some are married but all appreciate shanta who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das she also starred in deepa mehtas previous film fire the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water in an early scene the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears one of the men remarks jokingly that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along he is wrong the men make barbed little comments to each other spoken like jokes but with an undercurrent of fanaticism the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses it is easy to perceive in these squabbles the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter the group around shanta represents in a sense a united india and shanta herself the ideal motherland one which all love which inspires hindu muslim and sikh to live peacably together but the circle around shanta is sundered as is the state a sikh is persecuted hides then flees another man is murdered the group of friends will not meet again the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction a plate shattered on the floor a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child and most brutally when the tension escalates into violence a man is held down tied between two cars and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully the crux of earths plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz his sisters are killed in brutal fashion by hindus because they are muslim dil navaz seeks solace from shanta and asks in desperation that she marry him but she loves hasan and tenderly refuses dil navazs offer the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate despite the things he later does it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things the conclusion the consequence of dil navazs transformation is rather abrupt the story earth tells does not end it just stops it is an appropriate finish giving us closure would have imparted at least on an aesthetic level a sense of resolution of satisfaction but there was no resolution for india and pakistan they have been at war on a small or large scale for decades since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus there is no healing to be had no closure on any level despite the needless tacked on ending with voice over narration from lenny as an adult framing the story earth is in some ways an unexceptional movie it does not reinvent the wheel following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas but deepa mehtas directon is assured and the issues she addresses run deep earth does for india what movies like zhang yimous to live and tian zhuangzhuangs the blue kite did for china they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history such films strike me as inherently valuable even when flawed they may be biased or inaccurate but they bear the weight of human hardship and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other more inventive films often lack it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries the events shown may have happened decades ago but they still touch a nerve the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year in the near future india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen after seeing earth i have a much much better understanding, 1

no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordans harrowing humorous horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabes novel about young lad francie bradys eamonn owens descent into madness in s ireland on one hand it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs nugent fiona shaw on another hand i found it difficult to laugh at some of francies darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick needy child having been raised by a drunken father stephen rea and a suicidal mother aisling osullivan on yet another hand i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his for lack of a better word bad deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them however the butcher boys power is undeniable and the film as a whole is unforgettable perhaps because it is so disturbing what makes it so unsettling is the francies overall wink wink yet matter of fact attitude about everything expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie rea again think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs and youll sort of understand anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens love francie or hate him you cannot take your eyes off of owens the butcher boy truly is a twisted unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable in the lobby after the screening i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust that movie was so unfunny i didnt know what to expect its like something you chase for so long but then you dont know how to react when you get it i still dont know how to react michael jordan on winning his first nba championship in or my thoughts after meeting him on november, 1
everyone knows someone like giles death stuffy arrogant set in his ways and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with progress giles is a writer but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis his house looks like an immaculate museum with no television microwave word processor or other technological gadgets only the electric lights betray that hes living in the twentieth century not the nineteenth this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype but john hurt in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career turns erstwhile fogy giles into a three dimensional human being despite his tunnel vision its impossible not to like the man especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune love and as giles discovers during the course of this amusing warm hearted motion picture its possible to find the object of ones affection in the most unusual places giles who is a widower and a recluse does not frequent the cinema but when he learns that an e m forster film is playing at the local theater he screws up his courage and decides to go what he doesnt realize is that the movie house is showing two films the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress just as giles is about to leave however he notices ronnie bostock jason priestley and suddenly its love at first sight giles is enraptured and the moment hotpants college ii is over he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia including teen magazines and video tapes in order to watch those tapes giles must buy a vcr but he initially doesnt realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr eventually not satisfied with being the worlds foremost authority on bostock giles boards a plane and travels to long island where his idols home is located bostock is away when giles arrives but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnies supermodel girlfriend audrey fiona loewi eventually the actor arrives home and impressed with giles demeanor and intelligence he begins to rely on the older mans advice but while giles affection runs deep ronnies feelings are less constant love and death on long island is a comedy and a very funny one at that in fact for its first half the film is nearly perfect it suffers a fall off once giles reaches new york and the ending with its none too subtle homosexual overtones is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom writerdirector richard kwietniowski adapting from the novel by gilbert adair is on target in the process he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles but says a few things about the transforming power of love even if it is unrequited from start to finish this is clearly hurts movie hes in almost every frame its a role that the veteran actor must have relished because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure and does so by means of dialogue delivery body language and ever changing facial expressions jason priestley cashing in on his beverly hills image is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie he is charismatic and its not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie meanwhile solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always reliable maury chaykin love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one a social commentary it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment a buddy picturelove story ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days and a fish out of water tale victorian relic giles forced into the modern world yet despite the many laughs love and death offers it never takes cheap shots it has a vibrant beating heart and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile, 1
after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles as a master would teach an eager apprentice you caress the noodles with the chopsticks he says then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying see you soon of course its meant to be a parody but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat not something you like not something you enjoy but rather something you experience experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts trust me you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point juzo itamis tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western set in modern day japan a stranger goro tsutomu yamazaki comes into town and finds tampopo nobuko miyamoto the proprietor of a small hole in the wall noodle shop trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman pisken rikiya yasuoka goro to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen emerging bloodied but victorious goro finds that tampopos ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away just to eat a bowl of her ramen the problem is her fare is something less than popular and less than appetizing however goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert enlist the aid of a wealthy patron and make friends with the former enemy this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems take for example when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner the price is too high but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum tampopo meets him at his store late at night and he leads her to a back room she protests thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives but he insists just when she is about to bolt for the exit he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience this scene while comical is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation then of relief and discovery theres also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who despite their economic trappings are all gourmets and master sommeliers we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet the scene is meant to bring a laugh but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor food is something which everyone has in common and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in peoples lives a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor surrounded by her children she is obviously in her last hours of life her husband comes home and seeing her worsened condition demands that she get up and make dinner the viewer knows the husbands intention is not to be mean he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this in a near miracle the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal then brings it to her awaiting family as the family eats she looks on them and smiles preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her and for a brief moment she too enjoys the normalcy then she falls over dead for a moment the family is stunned but then the father yells at the children keep eating this is the last meal your mother ever made crying as they do so the family finishes the meal the scene is comical awkward moving and beautiful by including the vignettes itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film but surprisingly they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline instead they even help contribute to the idea that tampopos goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble because the film parodies a western the construction of the plot is fairly predictable but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the good guys come together for the final showdown in this case the showdown is against the ramen if they eat tampopos ramen soup and all tampopo knows she has succeeded its pretty obvious what the outcome will be but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life you can afford to cut it a little slack, 1
a big surprise to me the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such a dumb idea i really had no hope they replaced him just fine not with john goodman he didnt do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant whos ten this was another of my fears for the film but hes a really good dancer and plays a mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed things that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all im quite pleased that there were less car pile ups because they meant less music and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing theres a few early crashes and then one huge pile up but after that it all stops its just the music one of my problems with the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but theres no problems with this the music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up with the exception of johnny lang who cant sing all the musicians do a great job the only real problems i had was the special effects these were superfluous and a waste of money since the film isnt doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel which i want to see the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide http www geocities comhollywoodacademy remove no spam to reply drive carefully but recklessly mama childs toy the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise peter otoole, 1
theres an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy return of the jedi the final installment of the series is easily the most innovative action packed and entertaining of the three films the dark eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone instead for return of the jedi we have good triumphing decisively over evil a resolution to a love triangle and walking teddy bears even darth vader doesnt seem very intimidating this time around with the arrival of the emperor an apparition like creature played by ian mcdiarmid vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill princess leia carrie fisher lando calrissian billy dee williams chewbacca peter mayhew c p anthony daniels and r d kenny baker are on a rescue mission to lukes home planet of tatooine their goal to save han solo harrison ford from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt it is at jabbas home a creepy looking stone fortress guarded by hog nosed beasts that most of the added special effects come into play from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabbas sand barge the effects are top notch as soon as han is freed from his cryo freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt its back to outer space where the rebel alliance is about to face the empires newest threat a second more powerful death star that if activated could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor so while the fleet prepares for the final battle luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks there they are befriended by the ewoks the teddy bear like native race and luke fearing that his presence is endangering the group turns himself over to vader return of the jedi has some interesting elements the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well acted from a technical point of view the space battles are amazing easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films not only are there many many more ships but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved on one level return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects in the special edition even more ships are added making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films by now or then mark hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher have all matured in their on screen personas the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific as in empire billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy cunning and evil creature although hes not as imposing as vader was in star wars although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment with the spectacular new special effects the adorable ewoks the sinister jabba the hutt the evil emperor the same old millenium falcon darth vaders incredible betrayal the destruction of the new death star and the always lovable yoda return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang congratulations to george lucas whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come, 1
the blair witch project was perhaps one of a kind a unique film that played completely on its own merit managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses its success made a sequel inevitable but this is not the sequel i suspect anyone much wanted after the release of the blair witch project tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity selling twig sculptures stones and dirt like those in the movie and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn shouting get out of these woods and go home there is no goddamned blair witch jeff is one of those people who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage after he got released from the mental institution he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods on the blair witch hunt among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend the pregnant tristen who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called the blair witch history or hysteria and kim who dresses in black and has some psychic powers the last member of the crew is erica a young beautiful witch wannabe who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore saying the first rule of wicca is do no harm because whatever you do will come back to you threefold this strange group plunges into the woods where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parrs abandoned house strange things start happening when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies they are somehow lost in time as it loops uncontrollably back and forth they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods documentary director joe berlinger paradice lost helms blair witch leaving the creators of the first film dan myrick and ed sanches in the background the opening scenes the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film is a more promising approach because instead of trying to cover similar ground it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue in a way this is a typical hollywood sequel more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated of course in these situations quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody red forest with carter burwells being john malkovich and fargo musical score in the background you realize that with the exception of its title this film has absolutely nothing to do with the blair witch project blair witch was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection creating a completely different atmosphere with its graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the film has a very polished look which is impossible to associate with the first installment and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor the key is simplicity blair witch project had a story which was incredibly simple that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination the film was practically an empty screen on which we projected our most frightening nightmares the effect was incredibly powerful lasting and entir e everyone but in a different way book of shadows feels incredibly controlled and restrict here very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and clever that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with this is simply a less artistic film that doesnt have the talent and originality of its predecessor it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesnt always succeed but most importantly it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie which doesnt allow it to destroy the original in the end i cant call it a bad effort its less artistic not so scary and less original but certainly not bad its simply different in fact if you havent seen the blair witch project you might like this film for what it is a cross between the blair witch project and the scream films the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned and incredible sense of surrealism but its a common knowledge and experience that with a few exceptions every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making to me the story of the blair witch project seemed completed but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that the book of shadows is certainly assured and its already time to look forward to blair witch, 1
what a great film what a stunning touching heart wrenching heart warming life affirming miraculous film from its opening moments life is beautiful walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy a car with no brakes speeds through the town and guido roberto benigni motions people to move out of the way they mistake him to be the fascist president traveling to their town that day heil heil huh shortly thereafter the president drives through and people stare with blank faces this is standard but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff the clown who is also a jew triumphs over the anti semitic society in which he lives granted the great dictator comes to mind charlie chaplins almost masterpiece i think lib which benigni wrote and directed trumps gd in one essential point chaplins jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax but to do so he had to break completely from character benigni is given a similar situation he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race benignis guido stays in character and delivers the speech keeping the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept it is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema there are many other scenes especially in the first half which are bright and loopy and funny and silly slapstick reigns and although the film is subtitled there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed and although its focus is on the courtship of guido to dora played by nicoletta braschi benignis real life wife a silent undercurrent creeps in this is clearly a racist society evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others and it will soon affect him and his family the second half of the film takes place five years later in an unnamed concentration camp where guido dora by her insistence and their five year old son giosue giorgio cantarini are deported guido seeing the horrors is desperate to protect his wife and child for his wife who is separated from him he must find ways to communicate to her that he is all right for his son and this is the most controversial part of the film he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game its rules include hiding being very quiet and learning to not ask for seconds which raises the big questions how do we deal with pain with persecution with injustice on the worst level its said that tragedies bring out the best in people finding strengths they did not realize they had other times they deteriorate become overwhelmed with little strength or incentive to swim sometimes even people giggle in these moments as if there were a vacant emotion behind them yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds benignis guido realizes this he is the clown but he is not a fool he sees the slurs and the vandalism and while feeling the weight of the verbal attacks he still has the audacity to see if everyone around him perhaps even the antagonists laugh his liberty is stripped but not his dignity and certainly not the dignities of those around him its obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation but does so with a grinning joyful demeanor perhaps that is a form of denial perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster not unlike the very different brazil or perhaps this is an example of great fortitude with no weapons but wit whatever his purposes is subject to debate but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three dimensional characters stranded amidst a terrifyingly risky concept surprisingly it works it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust its not that the atrocities are trivialized far from it they dont have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror less is more i believe that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone and i like the theory that it is guidos alternate reality that were seeing however any criticism that this is rewriting history that the holocaust wasnt as bad as it seems is simply off target benignis film has won audience awards at cannes at toronto and is a definite shoo in for best foreign language film hopefully for best picture as well he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society it swept the italian academy awards controversy notwithstanding it is one of the great films this year and as of this writing the one to beat for best film masterful miraculous a must see, 1
