america loves convenience after all were the culture that invented the cell phone the hour atm and my most beloved the remote control yet perhaps this time with ghosts of mars we have taken our love of convenience to far ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails pill poppin martian cop sent with her squadron to retrieve demolition williams ice cube from a remote mining town for trial back home when she and her comrades appropriately dubbed the commander the rookies and the guy with the cool accent discover the towns residents slaughtered they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents head chopping alien possessed clutches filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks flashes sideways and viewpoint changes ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequences the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story ripped straight from the pages of a s zombie movie ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced most of these moments come off as kwik e mart wisdom dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other cube reminisces about his street life comparing the zombie stomping fun to me and my brother when we was kids apparently crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment but even in the films darkest moments fate conveniently lends a hand supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite yes in the future man may travel to space and conquer mars but nothing beats a good stick of tnt and as we all know every police station past present or future keeps a healthy supply on hand characters die heads are lopped off but they were only supporting roles anyway so why should we care as long as you have plenty of narcotics immunity is guaranteed eventually though even the most well trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation killing anything the machine guns cant handle explosions are fun and even if the nukes dont get them the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will in the end this film defines itself when our cops tribunal pronounces is that all you have to tell us for indeed john carpenter has run out of things to say and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story, 0
first rule of fight club is dont talk about fight club this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film because quite frankly its not even worth mentioning director david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge with crude humor an intolerable script and hours and minutes of pure torture im surprised i didnt walk out this just goes to show that hype kills its very rare that a film so hyped up as fight club turns out to be noteworthy and this is no exception the story goes like this edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions until he meets marla helena bonham carter norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when he spots her at a session that he also attended apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like literally living in pain why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me but things do get worse norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling and its on a plane that he meets tyler durden brad pitt the two men develop a bond and go out to a bar and by golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight how do they come up with this stuff anyway their fighting catches other pathetic losers attention and a club is formed out of all this mess there manages to lie a message fincher shows us that society is like robots we work in our jobs doing things step by step and want out our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are and we blame it on others call me crazy but this is common knowledge i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably even with two good actors and a solid actress they only manage to weaken the story i couldnt help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp it just shows how desperate the script is for attention i guess brad pitt was right for this role because i felt like beating him up myself his bothersome and depressing character made me disgusted at his million fee it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more helena bonham carter however really had no purpose she just popped up on screen mumbled some lines smoked and left this continues for what seems like hours the film drags on and my headache gets bigger while fight club nears what i think might be the end unfortunately by then the film hits rock bottom though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere minutes it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace on a side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment wont do any good if everything else is in need of support also im afraid that immature men might respond to the films violence the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult when the film ends im just glad to get home and take some advil youll either enjoy what the film has to offer or agree with ed norton when he says this is so f ing stupid, 0
all through its production and into the early days of its initial aborted pre release publicity hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood ultimately however paramount pictures nervous that this movie would be confused with s other underperforming disaster films dantes peak volcano changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year but to paraphrase the bard swill by any other name would smell as rank no number of name changes can help this picture its not just about a disaster it is a disaster hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute the best shot occurs during the opening credits as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg indiana as the water level slowly rises the community protected by an overworked dam is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud choked skies from that moment on its all downhill whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point it takes forever to get to the end credits this is one of the longest seeming minute motion pictures i have recently endured basically hard rain is one extended dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot outs theres a lot of water broken glass gunfire and explosions its all very routine and uninteresting because there arent any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense the films conclusion is so preposterous that its almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion graham yost the writer of both speed and hard rain surely understands that principle unfortunately neither he nor cinematographer turned director mikael salomon a far off place applies it the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition we see the same kinds of things speedboat chases flood damage shoot outs etc over and over again the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length the storyline gives us a number of paper thin characters in contrived circumstances theres tom christian slater the one dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash he and his partner charlie edward asner tvs lou grant get stuck on a street thats rapidly turning into a river a group of men led by jimmy morgan freeman arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers after charlie is killed in a shoot out tom hides the money then runs as he swims and boats his way through huntingburgs roads he encounters some of the locals karen minnie driver a would be love interest a bickering old couple richard dysart and betty white who are on hand to provide comic relief and the easily corrupted sheriff randy quaid whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives there isnt any real acting in this film christian slater utters a few lame one liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen randy quaid sneers a lot and is totally unconvincing morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances but they are defeated by the script freeman one of the best cinematic thespians working today looks suitably embarrassed to be here but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time to time following in the wake of twister this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesnt trust natures fury as the chief engine of conflict as a result we are saddled with an idiotic good guysbad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible thus far this year hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire firestorm and water hard rain fortunately there are only two elements left, 0
much ado about nothing ah how sweet the irony its accepted wisdom in some circles among english literature nuts mainly that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance he just doesnt understand shakespeare you will hear them say the bards work is apparently beyond criticism what a load of old cobblers if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaughs film of shakespeares comedy much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word its time to get a life get monty python get woody allen get john waters whatever just get a real taste of some clever witty risky comedy and banish this nonsense to where it belongs drama and tragedy was shakespeares strength to my sensibilities and im no stick in the mud much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever no kidding this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my years of movie going the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend as this was our day out and i hadnt seen her in ages but boy does she owe me one i wont spend too much time on the plot basically we follow the trials and tribulations of two would be couples one young the other older theres some dark treachery amongst all this but everyone is so awfully jolly that youd hardly know it mind you theres nothing wrong with the basic story good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound nothing wrong with most of the cast either branaugh emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers the problem is the script or more accurately shakespeares original text light comedy shouldnt be complex yet wrapped in elizabethan english the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good undemanding laugh the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves the actor once again miscast as a jealous half brother or something but when dissected and understood what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold ho ho ho boy likes girl ho ho ho men are such klutzes ho ho ho shes so awfully clumsy oh please theres wit in here somewhere im told i call it pretentious something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay in the end its cringeworthy watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience comedy bah humbug, 0
before the remake of psycho appears weve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film dial m for murder as usual hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing the film opens with emily paltrow and david viggo mortensen having fun in an loft apartment the problem is paltrow is married to stephen douglas who is not too happy when he discovers this affair if i was paltrow though id definitely go with mortensen less wrinkles anyhow stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition hell pay him to kill his lovely wife mortensen agrees but the murder goes awry and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses unfortunately the film dosent progress very fast in fact it moves like a tortoise with arthritis read very very s l o w the plot moves nowhere fast and only becomes exciting in very short bursts not too good for a thriller also the performances apart from douglas are below par paltrow showing immense talent in se en and sliding doors is strangely stilted even unconvincing in this movie mortensen is a little bit better coming across as a younger douglas but his role isnt meaty enough to show all his talent which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film which is does however i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking drinking womanizer with a creepy underside also popping up in the film is david suchet playing a shifty looking detective again its not a character were seeing on the screen its david suchet the director who bought us the fugitive piles on all the flash techniques such as zoom ins quick cuts etc the lighting is also interesting however looks cant save this film from the depths of mediocre and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway the screenplay is o k but theres some hackneyed sub plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street again and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched the characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel with a combination of no tension drama or decent characters a perfect murder is a failure all round and an incredible disappointment there are a few bright moments but they are far and few between the last thing a thriller should be is boring and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas you wouldnt be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder overall rating review by david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes, 0

talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters spice world is the feature film debut of the pre fabricated pop band the spice girls its intended as a sort of hard days night but ends up simply hard to watch when watching the spice girls im reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles and about as talented theres ginger geri halliwell the brainy one sporty melanie chisholm the athletic one baby emma bunton the childish one posh victoria adams the fashion conscious one and scary melanie brown the one with a tongue pierced back so far youre almost certain the post sticks out her throat the film itself doesnt really have a plot it follows the girls as they travel here and there culminating at their first live performance at albert hall the action however seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas the various misfires include an alien encounter a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls the shooting of a spice girls documentary a movie producer george wendt trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie nearly all of which though incredibly far fetched seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up a meeting with a pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends a boating adventure a bus race club hopping wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd even when they start to sing and an assorted number of musical performances press conferences and general all around celebrity stuff whew for some reason the film is littered with star cameos from elton john to elvis costello from bob hoskins to meat loaf heck even roger moore shows up though he cant decide if hes parodying himself as james bond or if hes lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld richard e grant has the largest secondary part a thankless role of the bands manager clifford the celebrity spotting is partially amusing and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film neither amusing or spontaneous when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring their songs are alright but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos my advice to fans is stay home and watch that video collection or at least spin that cd a couple of more times either option will be more enjoyable than the film non fans should know to stay well away from this one, 0

a movie like mortal kombat annihilation works and must be reviewed on multiple levels first theres the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie but occasionaly almost as if making an ironic self depreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery no no just kidding had you going there for a moment didnt i in all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoints that of a movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of a fan of the first movie andor a fan of the games the first movie mortal kombat concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and its billion inhabitants the mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth unfortunately shao khan was a poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet as our heroes assumed a fighting stance the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game id even go so far as to say that many folks who didnt know about the game probably enjoyed the movie the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didnt try to overachieve there were a lot of really cool fight scenes with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately non intrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot and as we know the movie was a smashing success at the box office mortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie shao khan has decided that hes going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament thereafter follows approximately minutes of film that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a real movie now too bad they didnt simply stick with the formula from the first movie i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture but here are the high points the acting is truly bad sandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst pieces of mis casting i think ive ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder in the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics i generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the u s in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but hes so totally wrong for this part that he doesnt even have the luxury of amused self awareness there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including a muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has a mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva for these reasons and many others i can only give the movie a unless youre a huge fan of the games andor the first movie in that case the following critiques also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as a fighter wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together a much more believable fight scene in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more sonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely there arent as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between silly silly folks and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud wrestling match lame and so obviously sexist even i politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animalities motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games i give this a youll probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one, 0
sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict but in the same time almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumets reputation a stranger among us rip off of peter weirs witness belongs to the latter category the heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york during one of such actions her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and as a result she becomes depressed in order to help her recover bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover that isnt easy because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal using peter weirs formula isnt the greatest flaw of this film even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent but the worst insult to viewers audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith the author of this review never liked this actress very much but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles role of emily eden unfortunately isnt one of them first of all she cant pass for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isnt much better screenplay by robert j avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch but on the other hand other actors are more convincing lee richardson as an old rabbi thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community also the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time, 0
would you believe in real life i mean that if you were julia roberts that youd be the ugly underdog to your sister the creepy catherine zeta jones let me tell you what reality is reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot thats reality americas sweethearts is the opposite of reality a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also ran presumably because she wears horn rimmed glasses and used to be overweight uh huh the plot follows two married mega movie stars gwen and eddie zeta jones and poor poor john cusack whose material gets worse every year on the eve of their new star vehicles release a film called time over time the only problem gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation and the press and public have not been forgiving think meg and dennis gosh and the director has vanished with the film holding the only print hostage veteran pr agent lee billy crystal is called upon to clean up the mess throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie presumably distracting the stupid stupid film critics into forgetting they havent seen the movie at all note to sony any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab and did i mention gwens sister kiki roberts is along for the ride and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way oh billy youre a scamp the script youve co written with peter tolan what planet are you from and bedazzled need i say more is a roast of hollywood and celebrity sure but its not a funny one yes crystal tells us hollywood is lying to our faces if you are surprised by this you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine its about to expire aside from a scant few zingers yeah se or winces rules americas sweethearts jokes arent funny its pace is choppy and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project not for headlining star julia roberts but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself i didnt time it the movies not that bad but its crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film bad move billy your jokes suck the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movies gags and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene how this movie earned a pg rating is a mystery to me julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friends wedding into a winning film but not even that tooth smile can save her here obviously aware of the ugliness before him director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria as a lisping spaniard christopher walken the insane time over time director and alan arkin a new age guru in a fright wig to crack wise none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken azaria comes off as a preening queen when hes supposed to be macho as for roth in case you dont know went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio revolution which produced this work hes back behind the camera for the first time in years itll probably be another before hes back again i could drone on about how americas sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies but that would get old instead ill settle for discussing the movies worst sin that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable not just in its plot but in its sentiment every single character in this film with the arguable exception of kiki is simply hateful and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains when you leave the theater youll ask yourself too why would i want any of these jerks to be happy, 0
tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out minutes into the movie the film which opened in canada during but was never released in the united states is based on a stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage and while its evident that this could be a fascinating live production the translation to the screen is a creative disaster enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art lifeless and tedious the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium tectonic plates has a storyline although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non traditional fashion with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences its not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious all but screaming look art although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters because were constantly made aware that were watching a play or a movie its impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas theyre not real sympathetic or believable im willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different but this particular experiment is not a success tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine marie gignac an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor jacques lapage one day he disappears and fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love madeleine travels to venice to kill herself while preparing to commit suicide she encounters drug addict constance celine bonnier who causes madeleine to re think her decision meanwhile jacques has moved to new york city where he starts cross dressing calls himself jennifer and becomes a successful counter culture talkshow host with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deafmute and cultural references that point to chopin george sand and jim morrison tectonic plates is unique if nothing else however as interesting as the film sounds and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising it never really delivers the tone is soporific the supposedly intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner although it doesnt take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant and the symbolism is obvious tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth but it takes one hundred minutes to get across this transparent point there are some worthwhile moments such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who arent bilingual the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because a its different b its not like anything theyve seen before and c its pretentious for everyone else its not only a waste of time but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage, 0
late in down to you the lead female character julia stiles states her greatest fear is having an artificial conversation with her boyfriend freddie prinze jr the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out fallen asleep or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy the film is a multi million dollar testament to everything artificial filled with characters motivation plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles freshman co ed at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out doing the previous in how cute it can be the happy couple psychoanalyze each other they pick out a song because as prinzes dj mother lucie arnez explains every couple needs a song he smells her shampoo she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love then in standard romantic comedy style things fall apart why well because they have to otherwise the couple cant make up and live presumably happily ever after down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together or even knowing each other but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat the supporting characters are remarkably flat and insultingly ridiculous as well stiles best friend rosario dawson is a pot head prinzes roommate shawn hatosy is a girl crazy fool who cant meet women and then there are the porn stars zak orth and selma blair he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television does the college lecture circuit and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film you know the average porn star the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime hes on screen the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes she is a porn star mostly so we know shes slutty so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted attempts at drama which means julia is going to cry include a pregnancy scare and the big break up these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes what happened here the cast is full of likable promising young actors stiles especially seems to be going places writerdirector kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last years extremely unpleasant the story of us for teen audiences the direction is film school grad obvious its stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen a pointless parody of cops characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion plus the whole story is told flashback style narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera this is the second film in a row following wing commander starring freddie prinze jr which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of shes all that if he doesnt start making better choices fast his future films wont be so lucky, 0
capsule the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension alien the should be in superscript is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen it continues the story of ripley the space trucker turned impromptu survivalist but seems remarkably uninterested in her in fact the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all its so elegaic and limp a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning at the end of the last film aliens ripley and two survivors were on their way home unfortunately an alien pod had been deposited in their ship and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod the pod crashes on firorina a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent ripley lives through the crash the others do not the prison is a grim place even as prisons go its been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks which provides no end of techno gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against lice are endemic and so ripleys head is shaved another surreal touch at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive but it doesnt stay that way one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches and soon a newly gestated alien is running amuck worse it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated whats weird is how little tension this generates except near the end when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable loud music shaky camerawork etc sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role and she does well with it but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do the doctor charles dance and another rather religious inmate charles s dutton very good hiave presence but theyre not asked to do anything with it in light of the impending sequel which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie i will not talk about the ending except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie its strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldnt have driven the rest of it, 0
another formula feel good quirky comedy from the british isles much like waking ned devine and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin the strength of this film lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol the film is tolerable until after its first hour it then falls completely apart becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to at least be viewed as containing a pertinent message its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about to be escalated into colombia the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future it has so far just ended up causing americas jails to be overcrowded with non violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing americas drug usage and drug supply billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war by backing a corrupt government remember vietnam with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam with this scenario closer to home so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war the films mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public something that should have been accepted some years ago is a theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that is better received late than never there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this rather than making it a police matter altogether the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle aged woman grace brenda blethyn who fell out of an airplane evidently committing suicide the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up without her knowledge their comfortable year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husbands enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london honey quick what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying is that when conferring with honey she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can the creditors swoop down on her like vultures her gardener and handyman matthew ferguson decides to stay on with her despite his last check bouncing since she is an expert amateur horticulturist he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants which he grows for private use the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high quality stuff for grace this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt for the scotsman matthew it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky valerie the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed the police sergeant campbell pretends not to notice what the bright lights in graces greenhouse is for the friendly vicar phillips counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you cant control and the doctor clunes enjoys smoking the weed for recreation the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big time drug dealer instead of having matthew go because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesnt want matthew to end up in jail it is interesting to note that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you only that one can go to jail the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london trying to find a drug dealer while dressed out of place in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole whereby it never recovered its dignity the film moves into the formula mode whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive as she meets an international drug dealer a frenchman tcheky karyo who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences thereby becoming a celebrity things work out in a ridiculous way where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded this unhip film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly but should be tolerated as something naughty middle aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute ummm, 0
capsule where are you tonight leni rienfenstal starship troopers is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography and bad pornography at that it is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun its so cynically calculatedly bone headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed its one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time why am i calling this movie pornography pornography in the abstract is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper as a near pornographic eternity i didnt agree with that assessment but i could see what was being implied the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout do er man do er that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers its literally like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening the film takes place in our future when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesnt appear to have intelligence to counterattack humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which theyre clearly capable of they send down grunts with m rifles this isnt heinlein its a bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome one scene has a journalist on a battlefield filimg soldiers being slaughtered and ends with groaning predictability said cameraman gets skewered too the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense they dont even behave like soldiers in a bad movie and therefore we dont care about them we hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate here we dont even hate the bugs whats there to hate hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine if theres anything really hateful there the movie doesnt know how to give it to us the screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps a better appelation would be screen typist and director the increasingly talent impaired paul verhoeven have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot whos great at getting out of tight situations and does it again and again and again once or twice is fine by the fifth or sixth time its worn out its welcome theres never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle also the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing but if one human gets cornered he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip uh huh the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi fascist flavor i say quasi because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action the gear the uniforms etc the movie doesnt have the nerve or the brains to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject the bumpers between scenes which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison like the rest of the movie theres more i suppose but its not worth it the acting is bland neither arsenic nor gravy the music disposable the camerawork turgid the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece, 0
best remembered for his understated performance as dr hannibal lecter in michael manns forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight hes only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loachs hidden agenda cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l i e which lot picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge big john feels the love that dares not speak its name but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light hes an even tempered funny robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems as opposed to their parents and friends both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused lives hell have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship charming them with temptations from the grown up world l i e stands for long island expressway which slices through the strip malls and middle class homes of suburbia filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a pretty transparent metaphor of dangerous escape for his year old protagonist howie paul franklin dano in his opening voice over howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road citing the l i e highway deaths of filmmaker alan j pakula songwriter harry chapin and his own mother on exit hes both fascinated and disturbed by the l i e and those feelings are projected onto big john who follows howie around in his bright red car but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesnt want to do this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies hes a beast but ashamed of it l i e would have worked best as a half hour short film about howies ill advised foray into big johns haven there is unnecessary padding with howies miserable dad bruce altman in the hot seat for a white collar crime degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle class houses and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise ass gary terrio billy kay a handsome artful dodger rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui not that we needed another movie on that subject these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length concurrently the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted cox sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo is all bluff and bluster dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent were so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious calling haley joel its surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene the restraint is admirable but l i e s screenplay doesnt always give them the best material when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem the moment feels a bit too precious director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bachs goldberg variations its too much there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big johns other boy toy walter masterson jealous over the newbie this plot thread predictably leads to violence not content to be a haunting observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world like terry zwigoffs superb ghost world cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note its typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex philosophical note in this regard l i e and countless other indie films share something in common with blockbuster action films problems are solved when the obstacle is removed how often does real life work this way to extend the question if a movie is striving for realism do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion, 0
unfortunately it doesnt get much more formulaic than one tough cop theres the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film bo dietl pronounced deedle baldwin is one tough cop a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia on top of that problem he has a drunk gambling addicted partner penn who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets i guess cops arent immune then throw into the mix the femme fatale gershon right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama but right in the middle of the film they throw in a completely un related plot point dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death once the case is solved the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso an insult if you ask me the performances were pretty good baldwin though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec does a fine job as one tough cop penn who also slips into an impression of his brother sean is even better as a loser tough guy cop what one tough cop lacks is originality this film offers nothing new nothing that you cant get from any cop film it screams sidney lumet all over the place perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman producers of lumets dog day afternoon and serpico but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film too much else is lacking i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture something that i almost never notice but once i saw that i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot at times i was hoping to see it one tough cop isnt laughable nor is it a terrible film but it just isnt unique it is a classic example of a film that didnt need to be made but one thing is for sure it could really use a better title, 0
janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker this is a by the books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs it also jumps on the ever popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator jay o sanders running for reelection denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent thats made the kennedy family so popular so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit she soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland almost misses the bus to town cant get a hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has a dog piss on her luggage and so on then comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute it happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way in the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean david ohara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side no points for guessing its the same dog that just made water on her luggage also no points for guessing garofalo hates ohara on sight thats how it works in movies like these i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that shed hate him for awhile then succumb to his charms live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which theyd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits i havent mentioned the movies twist yet garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss milo oshea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together rest assured hell do all he can to match up garofalo and ohara oh and in keeping with the matchmakers utter predictability he dies toward the end what the message here sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with a weak script i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together leary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole he even undoes himself with the old microphones still on after hes done giving the speech cliche both of them should have known better, 0
blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywoods premier leading men blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well although at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie the ideas behind blade are good as is the basic plot of the story but at times things seem to get a bit muddled and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once that really doesnt take away from the story too much but it does hurt it a little bit blade snipes is half man half vampire his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother but this isnt as easy as it seems because the vampires in blades world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires where do vampires get money well in blade they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea and a great addition to the movie blade runs up against the evil deacon frost stephen dorff a maverick in the vampire community he isnt content to live among humans and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all powerful vampire rendering him virtually unstoppable its up to blade to see that this doesnt transpire admittedly blade is style over substance through and through the story is a relatively forgettable one but it is fun none the less the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type this isnt a film that is going to win accolades for its performances and the actors know this the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise its a popcorn movie and no one involved has any illusions otherwise blades production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done although the mtv style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life very cool, 1
that thing you do r tom hankss screenwriting and directorial debut that thing you do has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment fun lively and oh so nice it is the latter quality however that becomes a hindrance for this s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast that thing focuses on the wonders a teen rock band from erie pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in when they score a major dance hit called of course that thing you do the groups members are naturally a diverse group theres brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy johnathon schaech girl crazy lenny steve zahn the lead guitarist a goofy geeky type known only as the bass player ethan embry and the films center guy tom everett scott the drummer who has aspirations in jazz along for the wonders ride to success is jimmys perpetually neglected galpal faye liv tyler hanks proves to be a capable writer director deftly recreating the innocent spirit of which hanks calls the last innocent year the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music which like the other recent period music film grace of my heart was expressly written for the film hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled its still playing in my mind as i write this it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors eliciting charming likable work from the entire cast most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler who is remarkable in delivering the films biggest and best dramatic moment the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early s they do not appear to be s grungers playacting retro yet for all the light frothy charms of that thing you do its nearly nice to a fault while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting everyone is so happy basking in the glow of overnight success marvelling at it all except toward the end but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness ending on an appropriately feel good note there isnt much of an edge throughout that thing the only thing that is remotely edgy is hankss turn as the wonders manager and thus becomes in danger of being so nice its bland but a little niceness goes a long way these days and theres no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do its just about impossible to hate its an inoffensive enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming if not singing that thing you do quite possibly for days to paraphrase a passage from the song though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play that thing you do, 1
as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell there is a wonderful eye catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film the shot has tibbs face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars to see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film in the heat of the night was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present preceding the very original a soldiers story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters the film which won best picture in focuses on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains tibbs is the perfect protagonist poitier also gives an excellent noteworthy voice to his character never nervous and always commanding his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing however unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople he would refer to tibbs as boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him as the film progresses though there is a very gradual change in the sheriff he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors what i really enjoyed about steigers character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil instead it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day jewisons determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate in the heat of the night shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the s it displays this perfectly however the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lacks interest it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane police officer sam being a suspect was not needed also it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson he managed to be in the two best movies of in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood, 1
seen may on home video rented one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise with some films it might be just a secondary issue but with dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie theres an old role playing computer game called d ja v wherein the player takes on the role of a man who cant remember who he is where he is and how he got there the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict the premise to this film is not unlike that game only this time we dont have control over the protagonist we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually its more than just the city its the whole reality that isnt just that neo gothic look a la batman blade runner but is so fully developed its almost a different genre completely later he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he has no idea whats going on other than the fact something is not right the fact theres a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre horrific tone the man doesnt know who he is nor where hes going and its interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him in fact this is the way all stories begin since its impossible to know the history of a character their feelings values morals etc until after weve observed them for a while but in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story eventually some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police we met inspector frank bumstead hurt a quiet unemotional soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time two other important characters are also introduced dr daniel p schreber sutherland a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be johns doctor and emma murdoch connelly a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film noir movies it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film he also contacts emma which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex mysterious back story but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in dark city which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot its lighting art direction and overall production design they dont seem to be able to afford any gratuities however that might also be whats keeping it from reaching its maximum potential by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come to realize that its all a hoax everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction but as the films tagline says last night one of us went off for reasons that are never clearly explained it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive a process known as tuning the aliens which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then this premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard he does provide some explanations such as that dr schreber is an assistant to the strangers because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form the aliens mix and match the memories of the citys population to see who will change and who will not in the process this creates for a good deal of deep thought provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world however where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant static and cold mediocre performances by hurt and connelly dont help either for example john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her yet in some scenes crucial to the films plot we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other which is also part of the films climax and ending and thats what proyas seems to be inferring with the film but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense ironically this is what made his first film the crow work so well which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical dark twisted world with dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message still the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable theres a lot to like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years dark city is what the movies are all about the escape from the real world, 1
youve heard all the hype youve seen all their faces natalie portman the professional as queen amidala liam neeson schindlers list as qui gon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting as obi wan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way as young anakin skywalker if youve read any reviews youve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy you also may have heard that this ones too kiddie friendly and doesnt have enough content for adults believe the hype the effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidalas sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth but theres something missing here and it isnt budget or effects its everything money cant buy the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters the most successful at this is liam neeson who as qui gon jinn a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi has quiet dignity and a wise commanding presence he is the anchor to this movie as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out portmans queen amidala and mcgregors obi wan kenobi dont fare nearly so well amidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation comes off as stoic stilted and caricatured it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life and obi wan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has so little screen time that hes nothing but a robin to qui gon jinns batman however mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity and he does a good job he also absolutely nails alec guiness obi wan in episode scottish accent and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise in fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit and thats one of the problems with this film i would never call myself a star wars fan especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days but ive always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america however if you are the one person in america who hasnt seen the films at all or even recently or who doesnt bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters you may be hopelessly lost for example one of the films main nefarious characters is senator palpatine for those of you not recently steeped in star wars trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vaders master in return of the jedi and empire strikes back so obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful a lot of the movie is like that r d and c po make token appearances and its obvious that lucas is banking on the audiences pre existing fondness for them because he doesnt do much to add to it in any way same goes for jabba the hutt who doesnt look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leias home planet which we never actually see that gets blown up in star wars show up or are mentioned briefly in passing whats the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty theres no meat no substance that makes you want to love the characters as they are not as they will be another problem is that there are actually too many alien characters in the film i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters and jar jar binks a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended as comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast unlike chewbacca and c po who got their humanity if youll pardon the expression from their interactions with the human characters jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles furthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot oddly this isnt just my judgment lucas has said that he designed this film for kids well hes done a good job the hero of this film of course is young anakin but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy thats not jake lloyds fault though he does a good job of being a cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him thats another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader warning spoilers ahead in my opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakins future evil in the film the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and theres nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie he has a doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isnt all hearts and roses is yodas hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn his explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead enter at your own risk of course the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul a scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts but has turned to the dark side this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup because qui gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force obi wan qui gons young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself so at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begins with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker did this story need to be told i would say no but is it a worthwhile movie to see absolutely if you dont enter the theater with jedi size expectations and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler happier time above all this is a fun movie not deep not meaningful and not profound but fun maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct because if lucas does the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most potential, 1
stendhals syndrome a condition where in the presence of art a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression suicidal behaviour and personality disorder grim stuff to be sure but the subject of a remarkable film from italys master of the horror thriller dario argento boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento it follows his disappointing american debut trauma the patchy opera and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late s based on the novel by graziella magherini the film stars argentos daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist killer visiting florence to follow up several leads she is lured by the killer alfredo thomas kretschmann to an art gallery a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints posing as a bystander alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer a strange game of cat and mouse begins a gripping story evolves and a coherent one too which may surprise those familiar with argentos often lumpy narratives the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop hunting killer scenario it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central characters psychological disintegration the script explores its psycho sexual themes with intelligence and candour perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers but as dark as its themes are the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years argento is once again working in his native italy and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent the films opening minutes segues between hallucination flashback and real time with tremendous style proof that at his most inspired argento remains one of the worlds most exhilarating filmmakers the cast is generally good though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless asia argentos performance is by turns risky awkward and fascinating its a difficult role and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo and marco leonardi of cinema paradiso and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy does okay as annas work colleague and increasingly confused love interest but perhaps the stendhal syndromes single most striking element is ennio morricones soundtrack active since the s morricone has scored over films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts its mostly a variation on the one theme a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards its been three decades since argento and morricone worked together this is a long welcome reunion if the film has a fault it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesnt quite reach a completely satisfying climax but by the closing scenes the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argentos career note see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web, 1
as i walked out of crouching tiger hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a great piece of work and viceversa attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology as the word implies a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality crouching tiger hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category crouching tiger hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore with the requisite blend of legend fantasy magic and mythology it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half gods greater than life purer than life stronger than life physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil which must choose between the two it is the gifted pupil who under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters are poignantly represented the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours de force not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art as are the prodigious leaps and flights to from and between rooftops the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line which takes place at an ordinary human level yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy do not assume however that the art is limp wristed for those who are put off by the art label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure action and romance there are no weak performances in this movie michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth humanity and wisdom chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart zhang ziyi is a budding superstar she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably kudos to screenwriters james schamus wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing choreographer yuen wo ping photography director peter pau and music director tan dun each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film ang lee as the director co producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes including those who hate martial arts movies dont miss it, 1
roman emperor marcus aurelius richard harris chooses his trusted general maximus russell crowe as his successor however the emperors evil son commodus joaquin phoenix murders his father before the announcement can be made and maximus as well as his family is sentenced to be executed maximus is able to escape his executioners but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo oliver reed proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money he being a former gladiator himself and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence style of moviemaking the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used its choppy slow motion which is unsettling and distracting its similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan but nowhere near as effective the actual gladiator battles are thrilling but also a bit disjointed many times its unclear as to exactly whats going on all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled were not sure whos blood or by whos hand though theres an instance of this earlier in the film too thats disappointing its comes when maximus escapes his executioners some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free but i still dont know exactly how he did it russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in s virtuosity for whatever reason his stardom never arrived but he should have it now from here on moviegoers should now be able to say lets go see the new russell crowe movie he gets the best scene in the film and one of the best moments of all recent movies when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum its both rousing and chilling joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character which could have easily happened commodus is conniving sneaky and whiny but phoenix never lets the character get silly its a very good and very creepy performance oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator and its a huge loss to the acting world ive always been fascinated with reed hes one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years its ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again as he gives a fun and sincere performance the film is dedicated to him and he will surely be missed reeds death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem as he still had scenes to be completed rather than recast the role and end up reshooting a great deal of footage a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of million dollars ironically that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film anyway this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of for about twenty seconds and if you arent looking for it you wont even be able to tell some of the other digital effects are less convincing however and like i always say noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately its sad that such a good film has these distractions movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events but is entirely a work of fiction however its a work of fiction thats great entertainment and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in a d, 1
hes back and its about time was the motto for this television series pilot i call it a pilot i dont care what fox network says revival of the cult classic british tv show doctor who that spawned no series which means there are no smart network execs out there not exactly news to a lot of people i know the motto was well chosen the series was simple it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies including the evil daleks and the master who appears in this feature played very badly by eric roberts as good as this revival was there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who is it the acting hell no paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys whove played the doctor including his predecessor and off screen friend sylvester mccoy who appears once more for the regeneration scene he looks right for the role is a brilliant actor and slips effortlessly into the role the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr grace holloway the doctors first companion that he kisses on screen she is not your typical female companion who screams and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor she is a tough spunky american and ashbrook shows this well young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee and ive seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end this film included which imho wastes his talent the only problem with the acting is eric roberts one time he had to say to mcganns doctor i always dress for the occasion but he broke it up and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric i always dress for the occasion you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act and whos also british like mcgann is as the doctor executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role i dunno who thought of casting him but if theyre reading this news flash eric roberts is not a star he rides on his sisters coattails and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him is this problem the kisses to the past they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them only whovians would and theyre good is it the script or the movie as a whole the script is a classy piece of work featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue and the movie as a whole is one fans will love and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series so what is it simple no plot the master on his last legs sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey but they accidentally land in san francisco december where the master with young street hood chang lees help opens the eye of harmony which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor with the help of female surgeon dr grace holloway doesnt close it by then virtually no plot i was told the movie wouldve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks but a lot of rewriting went on on the set that shows how smart people are as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting and that wouldve gotten a four star rating out of me, 1

well i know that stallone is years old now but in daylight he doesnt look it daylight is a great disaster movie if youve seen cliffhanger youll know stallones character already a guy with a bad past but is in the right place at the wrong time a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying very flammable toxic waste a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball and what a fire ball it was stallone a former emergency medical service man is chauffeuring a rich couple around when they reach the outside of the tunnel before the explosion then minutes into the movie boom from here on the plot takes a back seat and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat there are a few melodramatic parts here but they tend to work out well there is no general antagonist in this film but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that daylight is a great film i saw a non matinee showing of it and i thought it was worth every penny the characterizations are mostly flat one dimesional but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters rob cohen dragonheart does a great job with this film, 1
moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era youve got to know how to allocate your resources every dollar spent on a free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers in the nfl this leads to teams like the detroit lions who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract but can only field five guys named herb to block for him in the movies you end up with films like spawn with a huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit except that sanders doesnt have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages but like the lions star jackie doesnt have anybody to block for him almost every cent thats invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts and as chan does his own stunts the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills this leaves about cents to pay for things like directors chan directs scripts and dubbing and supporting characters not to mention the hideous title sequence this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain chans first release in this country rumble in the bronx was supposedly set in new york but was filmed in vancouver and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible heck jackie doesnt even have enough money for a haircut looks like much less a personal hairstylist in condor chan plays the same character hes always played himself a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen a master of both kung fu and slapstick fu jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert and is chased by a horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs one of the things i like about jackie chan movies no political correctness he is joined by three women who have little to do except scream jackie save us and misuse firearms the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere and hes more pathetic than evil en route we have an extended motorcycle chase scene a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel with the neo nazis and two confrontations with savage natives once at the secret desert base there is a long chop socky sequence followed by the films centerpiece a wind tunnel fight thats even better than the one in faceoff this is where the money was spent on well choreographed kung fu sequences on giant kevlar hamster balls on smashed up crates of bananas and on scorpions ignore the gaping holes in the plot how exactly if the villains legs were broken did he escape from the secret nazi base and why didnt he take the key with him dont worry about the production values or what exactly the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara just go see the movie operation condor has pretentions of being a raiders of the lost ark knockoff but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him with a lawrence kazdan screenplay a john williams score spielberg directing and george lucas producing condor might be an a movie however youve got to go with what youve got and what youve got in jackie chan is something special a talent that mainstream hollywood should could and ought to utilize, 1

synopsis in this movie steven spielberg one of todays finest directors attempts to spice up the s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque djimon hounsou a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery and his fellow prisoners cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders but since the americans dont speak cinques language the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves technically since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time people like cinque couldnt be kidnapped into slavery one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave lawyers baldwin and adams matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery rather than born slaves in order to get them out of prison as free men three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielbergs trademark panache flashy beginning lots of facial close ups big music and dramatic imagery a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters opinion making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life in fiction one invents purposeful clear cut good guys and bad guys puts the fictional characters in conflict and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion real life however consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around think thoughts and do nothing or come and go before events are resolved spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances, 1
will hunting matt damon is a natural genius for a movie character thats usually a death sentence its a trait associated with what my brother calls too good for this world movies like phenomenon or powder forgive me for spoiling the ending but will doesnt die this is no formula movie in fact its quite fresh and original its a character study more than anything and thats not surprising considering it was written by two actors damon and co star ben affleck will works whatever kind of job he can get first hes a janitor then he works construction off screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him on screen he hangs out with his friends picking fights in robust romanticized hemingway fashion lambeau stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves a math professor learns that the janitor will is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics having confirmed hes not a fluke or a savant he does what he can to get will into the education system he is firmly rejected finally will lands in jail for one of his fights lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him will barely decides to go for the therapy over prison lambeau treats will like a son hes proud of and amazed by wills accomplishments in mathematics he encourages will and tries to give him structure knowing that with a little discipline he could be bigger than einstein will isnt really interested in academia he knows he would be the best in his field and therefore spend all of his time in an office explaining math to people like lambeau he would rather work construction which breaks lambeaus heart meanwhile will attends his mandated therapy sessions its not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeaus a list will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade and how to keep them from affecting him shrink after shrink refuses to return after wills mockery lambeaus last hope is his old college roommate now a psychology teacher at a small time community college knowing that will is going to try to shred him too sean robin williams agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein true to form will finds seans emotional weakness and attacks but unlike the other shrinks sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions like a foster mother with a fussy child sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride like the foster mother sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach robin williams is excellent in this role hes not an actor with a great range but in the right roles he has great depth in this movie as in awakenings there comes a point when the quiet shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling i have compared will to a foster child and thats not entirely fair emotionally he has a lot to learn but he is not a child he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants sean his girlfriend his pals and lambeau all help him grow but he didnt start out asking for or particularly needing help his exceptional gift singled him out and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama its too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama it is emotionally engaging but its not quite larger than life this isnt a problem per se but at times i didnt know quite how to take it but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow it doesnt just happen it takes a good script good acting and good direction good will hunting has all three if you are at all inclined to see it by all means go, 1
plot derek zoolander is a male model he is also very dumb and impressionable for that reason he is secretly hired and trained so secret that even he doesnt know about it by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia who wants to abolish child labor in his country will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed will zoolander ever grace the world his new look is this a funny movie find out below critique theres a place in our world for stupid comedies films which dont pretend to take themselves seriously are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes theres also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history might be an ideal circumstance during which to relax by watching something so completely frivolous well if youre in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time of course comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny while others will grant them the stupid but consider it funny instead i personally enjoyed it for the most part cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry snap it was also nice to see several real life models with small roles in the movie not taking themselves too seriously and if youre the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films well dont look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn billy zane winona ryder christian slater david duchovny natalie portman and many many others i especially liked andy dicks complete make over as the masseuse hi larious but with all films of this type there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesnt work a few particulars which didnt strike my fancy included the bulimia and orgy sequence with christine taylor the break dance fighting and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this why not just make up a country instead of zeroing in on a certain people i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general since she wasnt all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then more zoolander dude but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me i almost pissed myself during the gas station disaster absolutely adored the walk off contest with david bowie as the judge no less and appreciated many of zoolanders moronic one liners i was a merman a merman and i dare you to get his monkey photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie youre a monkey derek a monkey i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film both of which zipped and zagged and established a nice rhythm to it all again its to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well if you thought the trailer was dumb skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something a film from which there is an obvious influence here blue steel baby yeah wheres joblo coming from austin powers austin powers deuce bigalow dude wheres my car freddy got fingered jay silent bob strike back joe dirt meet the parents say it isnt so, 1
youve seen this moment before recently a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing the difference is that when it happens to lili taylors nell in the haunting we dont care the hero of the sixth sense a young boy named cole is a rich creation and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike the seasons have changed since an ex patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe willis in the comfort of his own bedroom desperate to get his career back on track even at the expense of his crumbling marriage to williams of rushmore malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole osment the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolms would be killer scars on his body antisocial behaviour and the reluctance to reveal a big secret only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies and hospitalized as a result does he divulge to malcolm in a spine tingling scene that he sees dead people walking among us all the time malcolm assumes and given his profession reasonably so that cole is schizophrenic not psychic but the sincerity in coles anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures he will instead pursue the supernatural angle becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole who lives with his single mother lynn collette in the process the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist though shyamalan does somewhat unforgiveably crib the self rearranging kitchen business from the latter its far more heartwarming than frightening and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown but theyre not out to harm him really they just want to be heard even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us at first than they really are because were looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight year old thats right willis for the first time in years gives up the spotlight to his costar we appreciate malcolms domestic dilemma but we identify with cole recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed both actors deliver immensely likable performances and their dynamic is manifest willis convinces us that hes a doctor something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night osment is phenomenal a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do the sixth sense atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer tak fujimoto is actually a drama its spooky effective ad campaign is misleading only because i was expecting something different did i notice rather feel the movies running time which is just shy of two hours the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait im not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof but i admired its audacity, 1
the computer animated comedy shrek is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups for children it offers imaginative visuals appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces loads of action and a barrage of big laughs including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances apparently a requisite in contemporary family films for adults its a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids all in all shrek is a snappy ride although there are a couple of points i found disturbing but first the basics based very loosely on a childrens story shrek follows several momentous days in the life of the title character a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp until a local nobleman disturbs his peace petty tyrant lord farquaad take away the awk in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one liners owns the land on which shrek resides he proceeds to turn the ogres yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle as a result shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice pinocchio the big bad wolf the seven dwarfs and the three bears to name but a few an enraged shrek storms to the castle only to find farquaad john lithgow ready to bargain lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from snow white has shown him the way all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of the dating game when snow white is shown the cheeky announcer purrs even though she lives with seven men shes not easy farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona cameron diaz and offers shrek a deal if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon protected lava moat filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest accompanied by a motor mouthed donkey eddie murphy determined to make the green grump his best friend they finally hook up with the princess only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet for the matter the dragon offers a few surprises as well the movie references a great many other flicks from babe thatll do donkey thatll do to the graduate but the lions share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney the public domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits pinocchio is referred to as a possessed toy and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin he bellows get that dead broad off the table but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaads royal domicile which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like its a small world which brings me to disturbing point number one i laughed at all the disney swipes but found the mentality behind them a bit sad the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each others film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer heres a suggestion for the two boys grow up put the past behind you theres room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads cant play nice then go to your rooms the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad beyond all the irreverence shrek actually has a message people should learn to look beyond physical appearances because true beauty lies within its a lovely notion but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaads diminutive stature do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable the pompous selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers adding short jokes is simply mean still shrek is a rollicking good time the computer animation is mostly impressive although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky the voice work is strong particularly from eddie murphy the laughs come fast and furious and the moral tainted though it may be is a good one to trot out a clich shrek is fun for all ages parents though should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short tall skinny fat etc is a bad thing, 1

every year hollywood crowns a new it boy a young actor pegged for major movie stardom inheriting the mantle from last years winner matthew mcconaughey is matt damon and like mcconaughey he proves to be more than just a fresh young face as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release john grishams the rainmaker and good will hunting damon has his first major starring role a la mcconaughey in a john grisham adaptation in this case francis ford coppolas take on the rainmaker damon plays wet behind the ears attorney rudy baylor who immediately after passing the bar exam finds himself representing the mother mary kay place of a terminally ill young man john whitworth in a big league suit against a negligent insurance company while rudys and the films main concern is this case he also finds time to protect a young wife claire danes from her abusive husband melrose placer andrew shue in a mercifully brief role written for the screen and directed by coppola the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously coppolas most notable and effective contribution to the tried and true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself which largely comes in the presence of danny devito as rudys unlicensed co counsel and golden globe nominee jon voight as the insurance companys hotshot attorney the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous but danes is as superb as always then of course there is damon who nicely juggles the weighty the insurance case the spousal abuse and the humorous rudys often comical naivete requirements of his role without missing a beat as good as he is in the rainmaker damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself damon plays the title character will hunting a troubled young construction workerjanitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction an mit math professor stellan skarsgard taps his old college friend community college psychologist sean mcguire robin williams to counsel the abrasive standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life good will hunting is the touchy feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damons intelligent script touches even though no one and if so very few people can directly relate to wills burden of superhuman intelligence the insecurities he suffers are universal the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors williams delivers a nice dramatic turn affleck a hot up and coming actor himself chasing amy turns up in a warm and charming performance as wills best friend and the ever appealing minnie driver shines as wills harvard schooled love interest the clear standout in the cast though is damon who bravely does not soften wills prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard not to care for him so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine but based on his impressive work in john grishams the rainmaker and especially good will hunting it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come, 1
