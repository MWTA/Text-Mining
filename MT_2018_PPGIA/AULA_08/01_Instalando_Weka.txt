=====================
Installing Weka
=====================

Download Weka:

Version 3.8.1
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/weka/weka-3-8-1.zip


Version 3.6.1
https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/files/weka-3-6/3.6.1/weka-3-6-1.zip/download



First unzip the zip file. 
   This will create a new directory called weka-3-8-1. 

To run Weka, change into that directory and type:
   java -Xmx800m -jar weka.jar

where the -Xmx***m parameter denotes the java heap size (working memory)

Note that Java needs to be installed on your system for this to work. 
Also note, that using -jar will override your current CLASSPATH variable and only use the weka.jar.
